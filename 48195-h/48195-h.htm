<h2><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"><span class="smcap">Introduction.</span></a></h2>


<p>The general plan of the work was outlined by the chairman
of the Commission on Fisheries and Game, who has given attention
to such details as checking up scientific data, editing,
revising, and confirming results, reports, etc. The work has
been under the direct charge and personal supervision of the
biologist to the commission, Mr. D. L. Belding. The able
services of Prof. J. L. Kellogg of Williams College were early
enlisted, and many valuable results which we are able to offer
are the direct outcome of the practical application of the
minute details discovered by Professor Kellogg in his careful
study and original investigations of the anatomy and life histories
of the lamellibranch mollusks.</p>

<p>Of the other workers who, under the direction of Mr. Belding,
have contributed directly, special mention should be made of
Mr. J. R. Stevenson of Williams College, W. G. Vinal of Harvard
University, F. C. Lane of Boston University, A. A. Perkins
of Ipswich and C. L. Savery of Marion. Those who
have for a briefer time been identified with the work are R.
L. Buffum, W. H. Gates and K. B. Coulter of Williams College,
and Anson Handy of Harvard University.</p>

<p>In addition to the results here given, much valuable knowledge
has been acquired, particularly upon the life histories of
the scallop and of the quahaug, and the practical application of
this knowledge to the pursuit of sea farming. It is hoped
that the commission will later be enabled to publish these results.</p>

<p>The present report is limited to a statement of the condition
of the shellfish in each section of our coast, and to consideration
of practical methods for securing increased opportunities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
for food and livelihood by better utilization of naturally productive
lands under water. Since the chief purpose of legislative
action under which this work was undertaken was to
ascertain how the best economic results could be secured, we
have thought it wise to embody the results of our investigation
in a plan which is suggested as a basis for appropriate legislation
for making possible a suitable system of shellfish cultivation
similar to that which already exists in Rhode Island, Connecticut
and many other coast States, and which has been carried
on for more than two thousand years on the shores of the
Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<p>The following tentative outlines are offered, and it is intended
to subject each topic to an unprejudiced examination
and discussion:&mdash;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Proposed System of Culture for the Tidal Flats and
Waters of Massachusetts.</span></h3>

<p><i>The Purpose.</i>&mdash;The proposed system of shellfish culture
aims to develop the latent wealth of the tidal waters, to increase
the output of tidal flats already productive, and to make
possible the reclamation of large portions of the waste shore
areas of our Commonwealth. It is further designed to foster
dependent and allied industries; to extend the shellfish market,
both wholesale and retail; to multiply opportunities for the
transient visitors and shore cottagers to fish for clams and
quahaugs for family use, and to ensure fishermen a reliable
source of bait supply; to increase the earnings of the shore
fishermen, and to furnish work to thousands of unemployed;
to increase the value of shore property; to add to the taxable
property of the shore towns and cities of the State; to secure
to all the citizens of the State a proper return from an unutilized
State asset; to furnish the consuming public with a greater
quantity of sea food of guaranteed purity; and in every way,
both in the utilization of present and in the creation of new
resources to build up and develop the fast-declining shellfish
industries of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p><i>Private v. Public Ownership of Tidal Flats.</i>&mdash;The first difficulty
confronting this proposed system is the too frequently
accepted fallacy that all lands between the tide marks now are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
and should be held in common by the inhabitants of the shore
communities, to the exclusion of citizens from other sections
of the State,&mdash;an assumption which is directly contrary to
the more ancient law, supported by decisions of the highest
courts, that the right of taking shellfish is a public right, freely
open to any inhabitant of the State. Such unwarranted assumption
of exclusive rights in the shellfisheries by individuals,
corporations or towns sacrifices the rights of the majority.
The disastrous effect of this policy is plainly demonstrated in
the history of the rise and decline of the shellfisheries of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Secondly, this fallacious assumption is contrary to the fundamental
principles of all economic doctrines. It may be safely
affirmed that the individual ownership of property has proved
not only a success but even is a necessary condition of progress,
and has in fact at length become the foundation of all society.
It inevitably follows that if the system is justifiable in the case
of farm lands it is equally justifiable in the case of the tidal
flats, for the same principle is involved in each. It is therefore
fair to assume that if private ownership of farm land has
proved to be for the best interests of human progress, so private
ownership of the tidal flats will also be a benefit to the public.</p>

<p>It is not our purpose to discuss the underlying principle involved
in private ownership of property,&mdash;it is simply our
purpose to call attention to two facts: (1) if individual control
of real estate is just, private ownership of tidal flats and waters
is likewise just; (2) that individual control of such areas is
the only practical system yet devised capable of checking the
alarming decline in the shellfisheries and of developing them
to a normal state of productiveness, and rendering unnecessary
an annually increasing mass of restrictive legislation.</p>

<p><i>The Present System.</i>&mdash;The present system of controlling
the shellfisheries is based on the communal ownership of the
tidal flats. Ownership by the Commonwealth has degenerated
into a system of town control, whereby every coast community
has entire jurisdiction over its shellfisheries, to the practical
exclusion of citizens of all other towns. Thus at the present
time the mollusk fisheries of Massachusetts are divided into a
number of separate and disorganized units, which are incapable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
of working together for the best interests of the towns or of the
public. This communistic system is distinctly unsound, and
is in direct opposition to the principles of social and economic
development. The man who advocates keeping farm lands untilled
and in common, for the sake of the few wild blackberries
they might produce, would be considered mentally unbalanced;
but it is precisely this system which holds sway over our relatively
richer sea gardens. With no thought of seed time, but
only of harvest, the fertile tidal flats are yearly divested of their
fast-decreasing output by reckless and ruthless exploitation,
and valuable territories when once exhausted are allowed to
become barren. All hopes for the morrow are sacrificed to
the clamorous demands of the present. The more the supply
decreases, the more insistent becomes the demand; and the
greater the demand, the more relentless grows the campaign of
spoliation. The entire shore front of the Commonwealth is
scoured and combed by irresponsible aliens and by exemplars
of the "submerged tenth" who are now but despoilers, but who
if opportunity were present might become cultivators of the
flats rather than devastators. The thoughtful fisherman, who
would control the industry in a measure, is under present conditions
overruled by his selfish or short-sighted fellow workers,
and is of necessity forced to join their ranks by the clinching
argument that if the shellfisheries are to be ruined anyway, he
might as well have his share as long as they last. The theory
of public ownership of shellfisheries has been weighed in the
balance and found wanting. The necessity for some radical
change in the present system is becoming more and more apparent,
and a system of private control, with certain modifications,
is the logical result.</p>

<p><i>Need of Reform.</i>&mdash;The shellfish supply of Massachusetts
is steadily declining. So extensive is this decline that it is
unnecessary to mention the abundant proofs of almost complete
exhaustion in certain localities and of failing output in
others. While the apparent cause of this decrease is overfishing
and unsystematic digging, the real cause can be readily
traced to the present defective system of town control, which
has made possible, through inefficiency and neglect, the deplorable
condition of this important industry. Unless the de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>cline
is at once checked, within a very few years our valuable
shellfisheries will be exhausted to the point of commercial extinction.
The legislation of former years, essentially restrictive
and prohibitory in character, has unfortunately been constructed
on a false economic basis. Its aim has been to protect
these industries by restricting the demand rather than by
increasing the supply. What the future requires is not merely
protective or restrictive legislation, but rather constructive laws
for developing the shellfisheries. The system of shellfish culture
here presented appears to be the only practical method
for improving the condition of these industries in such a way
as to protect all vested interests of both private and public
rights, and at the same time to make possible adequate utilization
of the natural productive capacity.</p>

<p>In brief, the proposed system of shellfish culture is based
upon a system of leases to individuals. These leases should be
divided into two classes: (1) those covering the territory between
the tide lines, and consisting of small areas, from 1
to 2 acres; (2) the territory below low-water mark, comprised
of two classes of grants, which differ only in size and distance
from the shore,&mdash;the smaller (<i>a</i>), from 1 to 5 acres, to include
the shore waters, small bays and inlets, and the larger (<i>b</i>), of
unrestricted size, to be given in the deeper and more exposed
waters. The owners of all grants shall be permitted to plant and
grow all species of shellfish, and shall have exclusive control
of the fisheries area covered by such lease. The large and more
exposed grants, which cannot be economically worked without
considerable capital, should be available for companies; while
the smaller holdings, for which but small capital is required, are
restricted to the use of the individual shore fishermen. For
the tidal flats and shore waters but one-half of the whole territory
in any one township shall be leased, the other half still
remaining public property.</p>

<p><i>Success of this System.</i>&mdash;The system of private control by
leased grants is by no means a new and untried theory. In
actual operation for many years in this and other States, in
spite of lack of protection and other drawbacks which would
be eliminated from a perfected system, it has proved an unqualified
success. The rapid depletion and even extermination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
of the native oyster beds necessitated legislative consideration,
and for years the oyster industry above and below low-water
mark in this and other States has been dealt with by a similar
system. The plan here suggested would be but a direct extension
of a well-tested principle towards the cultivation of
other species of mollusks. The financial value to the fishermen
of such a step has been proved beyond all question in this
State during the past three years by the demonstrations of the
Massachusetts department of fisheries and game. These experiments
have proved that tidal flats, with small outlay of
capital and labor, will yield, acre for acre, a far more valuable
harvest than any upland garden.</p>

<p>This system has the further element of success by being
based on individual effort, in contrast to the present communal
regulation of shellfisheries. In all business individual initiative
and effort furnish the keynote of success, and the future
wellfare of the shellfisheries depends upon the application of
this principle.</p>

<p>Nature cannot without the aid and co-operation of man repair
the ill-advised, untimely and exhaustive inroads made in
her resources. This is shown in the thousands of acres of good
farm lands made unproductive by unwise treatment, and by
the wasteful destruction of our forests. It is as strikingly
shown in the decline of our shellfisheries. The fisherman exhausts
the wealth of the flats by destroying both young and
adults, and returns nothing. The result is decrease and ultimate
extermination. The farmer prepares his land carefully
and intelligently, plants his seed and in due time reaps a harvest.
If the fisherman could have similar rights over the
tidal areas, he could with far less labor and capital and with
far greater certainty year by year reap a continuous harvest
at all seasons. The success of the leasing system in other
States, notably Louisiana, Rhode Island and others, is definite
and conspicuous.</p>

<p><i>The Obstacles to this Proposed System.</i>&mdash;Before the proposed
system of titles to shellfish ground can be put in actual
operation, it is absolutely necessary to have all rights and special
privileges pertaining to shore areas revested in State control
by repeal of certain laws. In this centralization of author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>ity
four main factors must be carefully considered: (1) communal
rights to fisheries in tidal areas, as in the colonial beach
law of 1641-47; (2) the theory, practice and results of town
supervision and control; (3) the rights of riparian owners;
(4) the rights of the fishermen and of all other inhabitants
of the State. So important are all four that it is necessary to
discuss each in turn.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Communal Fishery Rights of the Public.</i>&mdash;The fundamental
principle upon which the shellfish laws of the State
are founded is the so-called beach or free fishing right of the
public. While in other States shore property extends only to
mean high water, in Massachusetts, Maine and Virginia, the
earliest States to enact colonial laws, the riparian property holders
own to mean low-water mark. But by specific exception
and according to further provisions of this same ancient law
the right of fishing (which includes the shellfisheries) below
high-water mark is free to any inhabitant of the Commonwealth.
The act reads as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Section 2.</span> Every inhabitant who is an householder shall have free
fishing and fowling in any great ponds, bays, coves and rivers, so far
as the sea ebbs and flows within the precincts of the town where they
dwell, unless the freemen of the same town or the General Court have
otherwise appropriated them.</p></div>

<p>It is necessary that some change be made in this law, which
at present offers no protection to the planters. Its repeal is
by no means necessary, as the matter can be adjusted by merely
adding "except for the taking of mollusks from the areas set
apart and leased for the cultivation of mollusks."</p>

<p>(2) <i>Results of Town Administration of Mollusk Fisheries.</i>&mdash;All
authority to control mollusk privileges was originally vested
in the State. The towns, as the ancient statutes will show, derived
this authority from the higher State authority, developed
their systems of local regulations or by-laws only with the
State permission, and even now they enjoy the fruits of these
concessions solely with the active consent of the Legislature.
Thus the State has ever been, and is at present, the source of
town control. The towns have no rights of supervision and control
over shellfisheries except as derived from the General Court.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
The State gave them this authority in the beginning. It follows,
therefore, that the Legislature can withdraw this delegated
authority at any time when it is convinced that it is for
the benefit of the State so to do. To those few who are directly
profiting at the expense of the many, this resumption of authority
by the State may seem at first sight a high-handed proceeding,
but a brief survey of the facts will prove it to be justly
warranted and eminently desirable. The present system of
town control has had a sufficient trial. It is in its very essentials
an un-business-like proceeding. A large number of towns
acting in this matter as disorganized units working independently
of one another could not in the nature of things evolve
any co-ordinated and unified system which would be to the
advantage of all. The problems involved are too complicated,
requiring both broad and special knowledge, which cannot be
acquired in a short term of experience. Lastly, the temptations
of local politics have been found to be too insistent to
guarantee completely fair allotment of valuable privileges.</p>

<p>The Legislature has not only acted unwisely in allowing the
towns in this respect thus to mismanage their affairs, but it
has not fulfilled its duty to the Commonwealth as a whole. The
Legislature has unwittingly delegated valuable sources of wealth
and revenue, the fruits of which should have been enjoyed at
least in some degree, directly or indirectly, by all citizens of
the Commonwealth alike as well as by those of the coast towns.
Many of the coast cities and towns have dealt with this opportunity
very unwisely, and few have developed or even maintained
unimpaired this extremely valuable asset of the State.
It cannot be too strongly emphasized that such important sources
of wealth as the shellfisheries are not the property of the coast
towns alone; they are the property of the whole Commonwealth,
and the whole Commonwealth should share in these benefits.
In allowing these valuable resources to be mismanaged and
dissipated by the shore towns, the Legislature has done a great
injury to all the inland communities, and, indeed, even to those
very coast towns for whose benefit such legislation was enacted.
The Legislature was not justified, in the first place, in granting
jurisdiction over these important industries belonging
equally to the whole Commonwealth and to the coast towns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
It was but an experiment. Inasmuch as these towns have
grossly mismanaged the trust placed in them, the Legislature
is doubly under the obligation to take advantage of the knowledge
gained by this experimental delegation of the State authority
to cities and towns. The completely obvious obligation
of the Legislature is to remove what is either tacitly or frankly
acknowledged by many city and town authorities to be an impossible
burden upon the city or town, and to restore to State
officers the general administrative control and supervision of
the public rights in the shellfisheries.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Riparian Ownership does not include Exclusive Fishing
Rights.</i>&mdash;The third objection is that in the assumption of
State control is involved the much-discussed and vaguely understood
question of riparian ownership. To make plain the
conditions relative to the fisheries, including the shellfisheries
on the tidal flats, it should be borne in mind that in only four
States, Virginia and Maryland, Massachusetts and Maine, does
the title of the riparian owner extend to low-water mark, but
in these States the right of fishing, fowling and boating are
specifically mentioned as not included in the title. Under the
existing laws owners of seashore property in Massachusetts
possess certain rights (though perhaps not in all cases clearly
defined) over the tidal areas within 100 rods of the mean high-water
mark. As the proposed system of shellfish grants deals
with this territory between high and low water marks, it is
necessary to see in what manner, if any, the rights at present
possessed by riparian owners would be impaired by the leasing
of certain rights of fishing. While the riparian owner has in
a measure authority over the territory which borders his upland,
there are certain specific limitations to this authority.
He does not have exclusive rights of hunting, boating and fishing
between the tide lines on his own property, but participates
in these rights equally with every citizen of this Commonwealth.
The courts have distinctly held that shellfish are fish, and that
a man may fish&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, dig clams&mdash;on the tidal flats adjoining
the shore without the consent of the riparian owner.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Rights of the Fishermen and of All Citizens.</i>&mdash;The
fishermen as a class are best located to benefit most from an
opportunity to lease exclusive fishing rights, whether they chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
to be riparian owners or not, though every other citizen of this
Commonwealth who so desired would not be excluded from an
opportunity to secure a similar lease. The personnel of the
fisher class has vastly changed in the past decade. There are
to-day two distinct types: The permanent resident, usually native
born, bound to a definite locality by ties of home and kin
and of long association,&mdash;a most useful type of citizen. Contrasted
with this is the other, a more rapidly increasing class,&mdash;foreign
born, unnaturalized, nomadic, a humble soldier of fortune,
a hanger-on in the outskirts of urban civilization, eking
out an existence by selling or eating the shellfish from the public
fishing grounds. Too ignorant to appreciate the importance
of sanitary precaution, the alien clammer haunts the
proscribed territory polluted by sewage, and does much to keep
the dangerous typhoid germ in active circulation in the community.</p>

<p>The public mollusk fisheries only foster such types of non-producers,
and prevent them from becoming desirable citizens.
The best class of fishermen and citizens has no advantage over
the worst, but is practically compelled to engage in the same
sort of petty buccaneering and wilfully destructive digging, in
order to prevent that portion and privilege of fishing which the
law says shall belong to every householder and freeman of the
Commonwealth from being appropriated by these humble freebooters,
who are at once the annoyance, the terror and the despair
of cottagers and shore dwellers.</p>

<p>All these conditions would be almost completely corrected
by the lease of the flats to individuals, thus removing from the
fishermen stultifying competition and compelling these irresponsible
wandering aliens to acquire definite location. But
most particularly a system of leasing would permit each person
to profit according to his industry, perseverance, thrift and
foresight.</p>

<p><i>The Grants.</i>&mdash;As previously stated, the grants should be
made into two divisions: (1) including suitable areas between
the high and low water marks; (2) territory below mean low-water
mark. The privilege of planting and growing all shellfish
should be given for both classes of grants. Class 1
would be primarily for the planting of clams, with additional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
rights over oysters and quahaugs; class 2 would be primarily
for the planting of quahaugs and oysters, with possible rights
over clams and scallops.</p>

<p>The grants should be leased for a limited period of years,
with the privilege of renewal provided the owner had fulfilled
the stipulated requirements of the lease. In order, however,
that these leases should not degenerate into deeds, to be handed
down from father to son, it might be necessary to assign a
maximum time limit during which a man might remain in
control of any particular lease. This would be merely fair
play to all concerned, for it would not be just to allow one man
to monopolize a particularly fine piece of property, while his
equally deserving neighbor had land of far less productive value.
In connection with this clause should follow some provisions
for payment of the value of improvements. Should there be
more than one claimant for lease of any particular area, some
principle of selection, such as priority of application, highest
bid, etc., should be established.</p>

<p>That there may be no holding of grants for purposes other
than those stipulated in the agreement, there should be a certain
cultural standard of excellence to be decided upon relative
to the use made of the granted areas. A clause of this kind
is necessary in order to keep the system in a proper state of
efficiency, and to insure the development of the shellfish industries.</p>

<p>All taxes on the capital invested in these grants and taxes
upon the income should go to the town in which the leasehold
is situated. In addition, there should be a just and equable
revenue assessed by the State on every grant, as rent for the
same. This rent should be apportioned according to a fixed
scale in determining the relative values of the grants, and
should be paid annually, under penalty of forfeiture. The
revenue might be divided into two parts: one part to go to
the State department having the control of the shellfisheries, for
the maintenance of a survey, control and protection of property
on leased areas, and other work; the second part to go to the
town treasury of the community in which the grant is located,
to be expended under the direction and control of responsible
State officials in restocking barren flats and otherwise develop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>ing
the shellfish upon its unleased territory which is open for
free public use.</p>

<p><i>Grants to be Nontransferable.</i>&mdash;These grants, while designed
for the use of all citizens of the Commonwealth, should
be made especially available for the poor man with little capital.
In order to assure the poor man of the enjoyment of his
privilege, it is necessary to guard against the possibility of undue
monopolization. Leases must, therefore, be strictly nontransferable.
Neither should areas be rented to another individual
under any consideration whatever. Every grant must
be for the benefit of its individual owner. He should be at
liberty to hire laborers to assist him in working his grant, but
not to transfer it in any way. Any attempt on his part to do
so should not only immediately result in the forfeiture of his
grant, but should also subject him to a heavy penalty.</p>

<p><i>Survey.</i>&mdash;In order to guard against confusion and to maintain
an orderly system, an accurate survey of all granted areas
should be made. The ranges of every grant should be determined
and recorded. The plots should be numbered and properly
staked or buoyed, and a record of the same, giving the
name of the owner, yearly rental and value, should be kept on
file at the proper town and State offices. The same system
which is now in operation in the oyster industry of other
States should be applied to all the mollusk fisheries of Massachusetts.</p>

<p><i>Administration.</i>&mdash;The department of the State government
under whose jurisdiction this system of leases may come should
be indued with full authority, properly defined, to supervise
the grants, furnish them with adequate protection by the employment
of State or town police, oversee the survey, allot the
grants, and to exercise such other powers as may be necessary
to develop the system, remedy its defects and strengthen its
efficiency.</p>

<p><i>Protection of Property and of the Rights granted by the
Lease.</i>&mdash;No system of shellfish grants is possible without absolute
protection. The lessee must be permitted to cultivate
his grant free from outside interference, and thus, with reasonably
good fortune, he can enjoy the fruits of his labors. This
protection, which is the greatest and most vital need of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
entire system, and the foundation upon which depends its whole
success, must be insured by proper legislation rigorously enforced,
and accompanied by severe penalties.</p>

<p><i>Leasing of the Grants.</i>&mdash;Every citizen of the Commonwealth
is entitled to participate in this system, but for obvious reasons
an inhabitant of any coast town should be given first choice of
grants within the boundary of his particular town. The first
grants might be given by allotment, but after the system had
become well established, they could be issued in the order of
their application.</p>

<p><i>Water Pollution.</i>&mdash;The sanitary condition of the marketed
shellfish taken from contaminated waters is not only at present
to some extent endangering the public health, but is placing an
undeserved stigma upon a most reputable and valuable source
of food supply for the public. The public should demand laws
closing, after proper scientific investigation, these polluted
areas, and conferring the power to thoroughly enforce such
laws. The danger arising from contamination should be reduced
to a minimum by prescribing some definite regulations
for transferring shellfish from these polluted waters to places
free from contamination, where the shellfish may in brief season
be rendered fit for the market.</p>

<p>It should be unlawful to use any brand, label or other device
for designation, intended to give the impression that certain
oysters offered for sale were grown at specified places, <i>e.g.</i>, Cotuit,
Wellfleet, Wareham, etc., unless such oysters were actually
planted, grown or cultivated within the towns or waters
designated, for a period of at least three months immediately
previous to the date of marketing. Furthermore, there should
be appointed proper inspectors, whose duties would be to guarantee
by certificates, labels and stamps the purity of shellfish
placed upon the market, and likewise have the power of enforcing
severe penalties on violators.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SHELLFISHERIES_OF_MASSACHUSETTS_THEIR" id="THE_SHELLFISHERIES_OF_MASSACHUSETTS_THEIR">THE SHELLFISHERIES OF MASSACHUSETTS: THEIR
PRESENT CONDITION AND EXTENT.</a></h2>


<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">D. L. Belding</span>, assisted by <span class="smcap">F. C. Lane</span>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dr. George W. Field</span>, <i>Chairman, Commission on Fisheries and Game</i>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&mdash;I herewith submit the following report upon the present
extent and condition of the shellfish industries of Massachusetts. The
following biological survey was made in connection with the work done
under chapters 49, 73, 78 and 93, Resolves of 1905, and chapter 74,
Resolves of 1906. The statistics and survey records which furnish the
basis of the report were obtained by D. L. Belding and F. C. Lane.</p>

<p class="center">Respectfully submitted,
</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">David L. Belding</span>,<br />
<i>Biologist</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Introduction.</span></h3>

<p>When money was first appropriated in 1905 for a three-year investigation
of the life, habits and methods of culture of the clam, quahaug,
oyster and scallop, provision was made for a survey of the present
productive and nonproductive areas suitable for the cultivation of these
four shellfish. The following report embodies the results of this survey.</p>

<p><i>A. Method of Work.</i>&mdash;In making this survey two objects were in
view, which permit the grouping of the work under two main heads:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) A survey of the productive and nonproductive shellfish areas
of the State was undertaken, showing by charts the location, extent and
abundance of each of the four shellfish, as well as the biological conditions
of the waters and soils of the areas along the entire coast which
could be made more productive under proper cultural methods. Wherever
possible, information as to the production of certain areas was
obtained from the shellfishermen as a supplement to the survey work.</p>

<p>(2) Statistical records of the four shellfish industries were formulated,
showing their value and extent as regards (<i>a</i>) production, (<i>b</i>)
capital invested, (<i>c</i>) men employed. Data for these records were obtained
from town records, from market reports and from the dealers
and shellfishermen, both by personal interviews and by tabulated forms
of printed questions. Owing to the present chaotic condition of the
shellfisheries, it has been impossible to obtain absolutely exact data.
The statistics that have been obtained are to all purposes correct, and
are the most exact figures ever published on the subject.</p>

<p><i>B. Value of the Survey.</i>&mdash;Before any reform measures of practical
value can be advanced, accurate and comprehensive knowledge of
the present shellfish situation in Massachusetts is absolutely essential.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Up to this time there have been only vague and inaccurate conjectures
as to the value of the shellfisheries, and even the fisherman, outside
his own district, has little knowledge of their extent and their economic
possibilities. The consumer has far less knowledge. For the first time
this problem of the Massachusetts shellfisheries has been approached
from the point of view of the economic biologist. This survey is intended
to present a concise yet detailed account of the present status of
the shellfisheries of Massachusetts, and is therefore the first step
towards the preservation of our shellfisheries by providing a workable
basis for the restocking of the barren and unproductive areas. It is
hoped that it will be of interest both to the fishermen and consumers.</p>

<p><i>C. Presentation of the Report.</i>&mdash;The first part of the report presents
the general results of the survey, <i>i.e.</i>, the present condition of the
shellfisheries, while the second part deals directly with details of the
survey. The report is divided into four parts, each shellfish being considered
separately. Under each is grouped (1) the industry as a whole;
(2) a statistical summary of the industry for the whole State; (3) the
towns of the State and their individual industries. A series of charts
showing the shellfish areas of the State makes clear the description of
the survey.</p>

<p><i>Geographical Situation.</i>&mdash;The peculiar geographical situation of
Massachusetts renders possible the production of the four edible
shellfish&mdash;clam, oyster, quahaug and scallop,&mdash;in great abundance.
Cape Cod forms the dividing line between the northern and the southern
fauna, which furnish the coast of Massachusetts with a diversity of
molluscan life. Zo&ouml;logically, the Massachusetts coast is the point where
the habitats of the northern (the soft clam, <i>Mya arenaria</i>) and the
southern clam (the quahaug, hard clam or little neck, <i>Venus mercenaria</i>)
overlap. Nature has favored Massachusetts with a coast indented
with bays, estuaries and inlets which are especially adapted for the
growth of marine food mollusks.</p>

<p><i>Former Natural Abundance.</i>&mdash;If we compare the natural shellfish
areas of to-day with those of former years, we find a great change.
All four shellfish formerly throve in large numbers in the numerous
bays and indentations of our coast line. The area between tide marks
was formerly inhabited by quantities of soft clams, and the muddy
patches just below low-water mark produced great numbers of quahaugs.
In the estuaries were extensive natural oyster beds. On our
shoals it was possible to gather many thousand bushels of scallops.
Now thousands of acres once productive lie barren, and we have but
a remnant of the former abundant yield.</p>

<p><i>Historical Wastefulness.</i>&mdash;History tells us that the Pilgrims at
Plymouth "sucked the abundance of the seas" and found health and
wealth. But between the lines of history we can read a tale of wastefulness
and prodigality with hardly a parallel, and to-day we find the
natural heritage of the shellfisheries almost totally wasted through
the careless indifference of our forefathers. Prof. James L. Kellogg, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the introduction to his "Notes on Marine Food Mollusks of Louisiana,"
gives the following excellent account of the exploiting of natural resources:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As one looks over the record of the settling of this country, and notes
how a continent was reclaimed from a state of nature, he can hardly fail
to be impressed with the reckless wastefulness of his ancestors in their use
of the treasures which nature, through eons of time, had been collecting.
In thousands of cases, natural resources, which, carefully conserved, would
have provided comfort and even luxury for generations of men, have been
dissipated and destroyed with no substantial benefit to any one. They scattered
our inheritance. Such knowledge dulls a feeling of gratitude that may
be due to them for their many beneficent acts,&mdash;though the truth probably
is that few of them ever had a thought of their descendants. Men
seldom seem to have a weighty sense of responsibility toward others than
those who immediately follow them. The history of the prodigality of our
ancestors since their occupation of this great continent has not fully been
written,&mdash;and it should be, in such a way that the present generation
might know it; for sometimes it seems as if the present generation were as
criminally careless of the natural resources that remain to it as were any
of those that are gone. Perhaps it is hardly that. We have learned some
wisdom from the past, because our attention has recently been drawn to the
fact of the annihilation of several former sources of subsistence. Rapidly
in America, in recent years, the struggle to obtain support for a family has
become more severe to the wage earner. In thirty years the increasing
fierceness of competition has resulted in a revolution of business methods.
In every profession and in every line of business only the most capable are
able to obtain what the mediocre received for their honest labor in the last
generation.</p>

<p>But it is easier to condemn the past for its failures than to recognize
and condemn those of our own generation. The average man really has a
blind and unreasoning faith in his own time, and to laud only its successes
is to be applauded as an optimist. In the present stage of our
national life we certainly have no room for the pessimist, who is merely a
dyspeptic faultfinder; nor for the optimist, who blinds his eyes to our faults
and mistakes, and so fails to read their priceless lessons. Instead, our intelligence,
as a race, has reached that degree of development which should
give it the courage to consider "things as they are."</p>

<p>Considering things as they are, we must admit that we are not realizing
our obligations to future generations in many of the ways in which we are
misusing our natural resources. This waste is often deliberate, though usually
due to the notion that nature's supplies, especially of living organisms,
are limitless. The waste of 70 or 80 per cent, in lumbering the Oregon
"big trees," and the clean sweep of the Louisiana pine, now in progress, is
deliberately calculated destruction for present gain,&mdash;and the future may
take care of itself. In making millionaires of a very few men, most of
whom are still living, a large part of the lower peninsula of Michigan was
made a hopeless desert. To "cut and come again" is not a part of the
moral codes of such men. It seems to mean sacrifice; and yet they are woefully
mistaken, even in that.</p>

<p>But most often, no doubt, the extinction of useful animals and plants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
that we have so often witnessed, has been due to the ignorant assumption
that, under any circumstances, the supply would last forever. This idea
seems especially to prevail concerning marine food animals. The fact that
the sea is vast might naturally give the impression that its inhabitants are
numberless.... But when a natural food supply nears complete annihilation,
men begin to think of the necessity of a method of artificial culture.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></div>

<p><i>Present Unimproved Resources.</i>&mdash;In spite of the wastefulness of
former generations, many areas can again be made to produce the
normal yield if proper and adequate measures are promptly taken to
restore to the flats, estuaries and bays of Massachusetts their normal
productive capacity. In spite of the fact that some of the natural beds
have entirely disappeared, either "fished out" or buried under the
d&eacute;bris of civilization, and others are in imminent danger of becoming
exhausted, Massachusetts still possesses a sufficient natural supply to
restock most of these barren areas.</p>

<p><i>Possibilities of Development.</i>&mdash;Opportunities for development
are alluring. The shellfisheries could be increased, in these days of rapid
transit and marketing facilities, into industries which would furnish
steady employment for thousands of men and women, both directly
and indirectly, resulting in a product valued at a minimum of $3,000,000
annually, with possibilities of indefinite expansion. At present the idea
of marine farming attracts popular attention. The conditions are
parallel to agriculture, except that in the case of marine farming the
crops are more certain,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, are not subject to so many fatalities.
The experiments of the Department of Fisheries and Game for the
past three years have proved that cultivation of shellfish offers great
inducements and profit to both individuals and towns. When the present
waste areas are again made productive, the value of the annual
catch should be increased tenfold.</p>

<p>Massachusetts fishermen to-day receive an annual income of $685,705
from the shellfisheries, which approximately cover a productive area
of 40,000 acres. Under the present methods of production, the average
value per acre is only $17; each acre, if properly farmed, should furnish
an annual production of at least $100, or six times the present
yield. The shellfish areas of Massachusetts which are at present
utilized are giving almost a minimum production, instead of the enormous
yield which they are capable of furnishing. All that is necessary
to procure the maximum yield is the application of systematic cultural
methods, instead of relying on an impoverished natural supply. Not
only are the productive areas furnishing far less than they are capable
of producing, but also Massachusetts possesses 6,000 acres of barren
flats, which should become, under the proper cultural methods, as valuable
as the productive areas. (This has been experimentally demonstrated
by the commission.) While it is possible to develop, through
cultural methods, these latent natural resources, it will take years to
bring them to a high degree of development. It can be partially accomplished,
at least, in the next few years, and the present production increased
several times, <i>as nature responds to the slightest intelligent
effort of man, and gives large returns</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Decline of the Shellfisheries.</span></h3>

<p><i>A. Is there a Decline?</i></p>

<p>(1) So obvious is the general decline of the shellfisheries that almost
every one is aware, through the increasing prices and difficulty of supplying
the demand, that the natural supply is becoming exhausted.</p>

<p>(2) Statistical figures of the shellfish production not only show a decline,
but conceal a rapid diminution of the supply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>(3) Production statistics alone should never be taken as typifying
the real conditions of an industry, as such figures are often extremely
deceiving. For instance:&mdash;</p>

<p>(4) The increased prices, stimulated by an increasing demand, have
caused a greater number of men, equipped with the best modern implements,
to swell the production by overworking shellfish areas which
in reality are not one-fourth so productive as they were ten years ago.</p>

<p>While the general decline of the shellfisheries is a matter of public
knowledge, specific illustrations of this decline have been lacking. The
present report calls attention to actual facts as proofs of the decline
of each shellfishery, by a comparison of the present conditions in various
localities with the conditions of 1879. The only past record of
Massachusetts shellfisheries of any importance is found in the report
of the United States Fish Commission for 1883, and, although this is
very limited, it is sufficient to furnish many examples of the extinction
or decline of the shellfisheries in certain localities.</p>

<p>In a general consideration of the shellfisheries, it is noticeable that in
certain localities the extinction of the industry has been total, in others
only partial, while others have remained unchanged or have even improved.
This last class is found either where the natural advantages
are so great that the resources have not been exploited, or where men
have, through wise laws and cultural methods (as in the oyster industry),
preserved and built up the shellfisheries.</p>

<p><i>1879</i> v. <i>1907</i>.&mdash;In comparing the present condition of the shellfisheries
with that of 1879, it will be seen that many changes have taken
place. Even twenty-five years ago inroads were being made upon the
natural supply; from that time to the present can be traced a steady
decline. During the past five years the production has been augmented
by additional men, who have entered into the business under the attraction
of higher prices, and the extension of the quahaug and oyster
fisheries. Though the annual catch is greater, a disproportionately
greater amount of time, labor and capital is required to secure an
equal quantity of shellfish.</p>

Wellfleet, Nantucket.</p>

<p>(5) Quahaug industry: Chatham, Buzzards Bay, Fall River district.</p>

<p>These are only a few of the more prominent cases. Similar cases will
be found all along the coast of Massachusetts, and no one can deny
that the natural supply is rapidly becoming exhausted, and that methods
are needed to increase the production, or at least to save the little that
remains.</p>

<p><i>B. Causes of the Decline.</i></p>

<p>I. <i>An Increasing Demand.</i>&mdash;The indirect cause of the decline of the
shellfisheries is the increased demand. To-day more shellfish are consumed
than ever before, and the demand is much greater each succeeding
year. It is an economic principle that there must be an equilibrium between
supply and demand. If the demand is increasing, either the supply
has to increase to meet the demand, or the price of the commodity
goes up and a new equilibrium is established. The supply must equal
the demand of the market. This increasing demand has worked havoc
with the shellfisheries. There was a time when the natural supply was
of such abundance that the moderate demand of those early days could
be met without injury to the fishery. Soon this limit was passed, and
with a steadily increasing demand came a corresponding drain on the
natural resources, which little by little started a decline, the result of
which is to-day apparent.</p>

<p>The ill-advised policy of the past has been to check the demand by
various devices, such as closed seasons, limited daily production, etc.
These not only have proved without benefit to the fisherman, but also
have hurt the consumer by the increased price. The demand can be
checked by raising the price, but this tends towards a class distinction
between the rich and the poor. The poor man should be able to enjoy
"the bounties of the sea" as well as the rich. The policy of the future
should be not to check the demand, but rather to increase the supply.</p>

<p>Several causes contribute to this demand, which has unlimited possibilities
of expansion:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The popularity of shellfish as an article of diet is steadily increasing,
not merely for its nutritive value, but for variety and change
in diet. Fashionable fads, <i>i.e.</i>, the "little neck" of the restaurants and
hotels, contribute to the popularity of these shellfish.</p>

<p>(2) In the present age, transportation facilities and cold storage
make possible shipments to all parts of the United States, and continually
widen the market for sea foods.</p>

<p>(3) The influx of summer people to the seashore not only causes an
additional summer demand, but also widens the popular knowledge of
these edible mollusks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>(4) Advertising and more attractive methods of preserving and
selling sea food by the dealers still further increase the demand.</p>

<p>II. <i>Overfishing.</i>&mdash;The immediate and direct cause of the decline is
<i>overfishing</i>. Increased demand causes a severe drain upon the shellfish
beds, which soon leads to <i>over</i>fishing. It is not merely the hard working
of the beds, but the continuous unmethodical and indiscriminate fishing
which has caused the total extermination of once flourishing beds in certain
localities. Under present methods a bed is worked until all its
natural recuperatory power is exhausted, and then it is thrust aside as
worthless, a barren area. Prof. Jacob Reighard, in "Methods of
Plankton Investigation in their Relation to Practical Problems,"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> aptly
sums up the situation in his opening paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In this country the fisherman as a rule continues to fish in any locality
until fishing in that locality has become unprofitable. He then moves his
operations to new waters until these in turn are exhausted. He is apt to
look upon each new body of water as inexhaustible, and rarely has occasion
to ask himself whether it is possible to determine in advance the amount of
fish that he may annually take from the water without soon depleting it.</p></div>

<p>In this way the shellfish beds have become exhausted through the indifference
and lack of knowledge on the part of the fishing public. In
colonial days the resources of the shellfisheries were apparently inexhaustible.
The conviction that man could ever exhaust the resources
of nature took firm hold of the Puritan mind, and even in the present
generation many still cling to this illogical doctrine, although proof to
the contrary can be seen on all sides. This idea has caused great harm
to the shellfisheries, stimulating men to wreck certain localities by overfishing.</p>

<p>III. <i>Pollution of Harbors and Estuaries and the Ill Effects upon
Public Health through the Shellfisheries.</i>&mdash;The unscientific disposal of
sewage, sludge, garbage and factory waste may tend to rapidly fill up
the harbor channels, as well as the areas where the currents are not so
rapid.</p>

<p>Competent authorities scout the idea that Boston harbor is at present
filling up to any considerable degree with sewage sludge, but the problem
must be met in the not distant future. This sewage sludge upon
entering salt or brackish water precipitates much more rapidly than in
fresh water or upon land, and becomes relatively insoluble, hence the
accumulation in harbors, <i>e.g.</i>, Boston and New Bedford harbors and
the estuaries of the Merrimac, Taunton and other rivers. This sludge,
instead of undergoing the normal rapid oxidation and nitrification, as it
does when exposed to the air on land, undergoes in the sea water a
series of changes, mainly putrefactive, which results in the production
of chemical substances which in solution may (1) drive away the fish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
which in incredible quantities formerly resorted to that place; (2)
impair the vitality and even kill whatever fish spawn or fry may be
present; (3) check the growth of or completely destroy the microscopic
plants and animals which serve as food for the young fish and shellfish;
(4) by developing areas of oily film floating upon the surface of the
water, enormous numbers of the surface-swimming larv&aelig; of clams,
quahaugs, scallops, oysters, mussels and other marine animals may be
destroyed annually. But most serious of all is the fact that all the
edible mollusks, notably the clam, quahaug, oyster and mussel, act as
living filters, whose function is to remove from the water the bacteria
and other microscopic plants and animals. Most of these microscopic
organisms serve as food for the mollusk; and in instances where the mollusk
is eaten raw or imperfectly cooked, man is liable to infection, if the
bacillus of typhoid fever or other disease chances to be present in the
mollusk. Though the chance of such infection is remote, it is nevertheless
actually operative. Many typhoid epidemics in this country and
abroad have been found to be directly referable to shellfish from sewage-polluted
waters. For these reasons approximately 1,500 acres in
Boston harbor and 700 acres in New Bedford harbor have become unsuitable
for the growth of shellfish; and the State Board of Health,
after investigation, decided that clams, oysters and quahaugs found
within these areas are likely to be the direct cause of a dangerous epidemic
of typhoid. For this reason the taking of these shellfish for any
purpose was very properly prohibited; but at the last session of the
Legislature a bill was passed which permitted the taking of such shellfish
for bait, upon securing permits from the Board of Health, and providing
heavy penalties for both buying and selling. As a matter of fact,
however, it is well-nigh impracticable to properly enforce this law, for
the reason that it is possible only in very rare instances to keep any one
lot of clams known to have been dug under these conditions under surveillance
from the time of digging until they are placed upon the hook
as bait. Complete prevention of the <i>taking</i> of such shellfish is the only
method by which the public health can be properly safeguarded. Even
though in our opinion the annual financial loss to the public from the
destruction of this public fishery by the dumping of city sewage into the
water is not less than $400,000, the public health is of greater
consequence, and should not be jeopardized, as is the fact under present
conditions. Until such a time as the public realize that economic disposal
of sewage must take place on land rather than in water, laws
absolutely preventing any contact with the infected shellfish should be
enforced without exception. In instances like these it is greatly to be
deplored that but rarely under our system of government can legislation,
which the best knowledge and common-sense demand for the public
weal, be passed in its adequate and beneficial entirety, but is so frequently
emasculated in the selfish interests of a few persons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>IV. <i>Natural Agencies.</i>&mdash;The above causes are given as they are
obviously important, but by no means are they to be considered the only
reasons. Geographic and climatic changes often explain the extinction
of shellfish in certain localities.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Present Abuses of the Shellfisheries.</span></h3>

<p>Not only has this survey shown by specific examples the alarming but
actual decline of the natural shellfish supply (in spite of deceptive production
statistics), but it has brought to light numerous evils of various
kinds. These abuses have developed gradually with the rise of the
shellfisheries, until at the present day they cannot be overlooked or considered
unimportant. So closely are these connected with the present
status of our shellfishery that upon their abolition depends its future
success or failure. Some need immediate attention; others will require
attention later. After a thorough and competent investigation, remedies
for the correction of each evil should be applied.</p>

<p>In the future Massachusetts will have to utilize all her wealth of
natural resources, to keep her leading position among the other States
of the Union. To do this she should turn to her sea fisheries,
which have in the past made her rich, and hold forth prospects of
greater wealth in the future. Untold possibilities of wealth rest with
her shellfisheries, if obsolete methods and traditions can be cast aside.
In any age of progress the ancient and worthless must be buried beneath
the ruins of the past, while the newer and better take their place.
There is no more flagrant example of obsolete methods and traditions
holding in check the development of an industry than with the shellfisheries,
and it is time that Massachusetts realized these limitations.</p>

<p>The shellfisheries of Massachusetts are in a chaotic state, both legally
and economically. The finest natural facilities are wasted, and thousands
of acres of profitable flats are allowed to lie barren merely for a
lack of initiative on the part of the general public. This chaotic and
unproductive state will exist until both the consumer and the fishermen
alike understand the true condition of affairs, and realize that in the
bays, estuaries and flats of Massachusetts lies as much or more wealth,
acre for acre, as in the most productive market gardens.</p>

<p>In Rhode Island the clam and scallop fisheries have almost disappeared.
Five or ten years from now the shellfisheries of Massachusetts
will be in a similar condition, and beyond remedy. Now is the time for
reform. The solution of the problem is simple. Shellfish farming is the
only possible way in which Massachusetts can restore her natural supply
to its former abundance.</p>

<p>I. <i>The Shellfish Laws.</i>&mdash;The first evils which demand attention are
the existing shellfish laws. While these are supposed to wisely regulate
the shellfisheries, in reality they do more harm than good, and are
direct obstacles to any movement toward improving the natural re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>sources.
Before Massachusetts can take any steps toward cultivating
her unproductive shellfish areas, it will be necessary to modify the worst
of these laws.</p>

<p><i>A. Fishery Rights of the Public.</i>&mdash;The fundamental principle
upon which the shellfish laws of the State are founded is the so-called
beach or free fishing rights of the public. While in other States property
extends only to mean high water, in Massachusetts the property
holders own to extreme low-water mark. Nevertheless, according to
further provisions of this ancient law, the right of fishing (which includes
the shellfisheries) below high-water mark is free to any inhabitant
of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Origin.</i>&mdash;The first authentic record of this law is found under
an act of Massachusetts, in 1641-47, by which every householder was
allowed "free fishing and fowling" in any of the great ponds, bays,
coves and rivers, as far "as the sea ebbs and flows," in their respective
towns, unless "the freemen" or the General Court "had otherwise
appropriated them." From this date the shellfisheries were declared
to be forever the property of the whole people, <i>i.e.</i>, the State, and have
been for a long period open to any inhabitant of the State who wished
to dig the shellfish for food or for bait.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Early Benefits.</i>&mdash;In the early days, when the natural supply
was apparently inexhaustible and practically the entire population resided
on or near the seacoast, it was just that all people should have
common rights to the shore fisheries. As long as the natural supply
was more than sufficient for the demand, no law could have been better
adapted for the public good.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Present Inadequacy.</i>&mdash;Two hundred and fifty years have passed
since this law was first made. The condition of the shellfisheries has
changed. No longer do the flats of Massachusetts yield the enormous
harvest of former years, but lie barren and unproductive. The law
which once was a benefit to all has now become antiquated, and incapable
of meeting the new conditions.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Evil Effects.</i>&mdash;If this law were merely antiquated, it could be
laid aside unnoticed. On the contrary, as applied to the present conditions
of the shellfisheries it not only checks any advancement, but
works positive harm. From the mistaken comprehension of the so-called
beach rights of the people, the general public throughout the State is
forced to pay an exorbitant price for sea food, and the enterprising
fishermen are deprived of a more profitable livelihood. The present
law discriminates against the progressive majority of fishermen in
order to benefit a small unprogressive element.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Protection.</i>&mdash;If shellfish farming is ever to be put on a paying
basis, it is essential that the planter have absolute <i>protection</i>. No man
is willing to invest capital and labor when protection cannot be guaranteed.
What good does it do a man to plant a hundred bushels of
clams, if the next person has a legal right to dig them? Since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
law absolutely refuses any protection to the shellfish culturist, Massachusetts
can never restock her barren flats and re-establish her shellfisheries
until this law is modified to meet the changed conditions.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Who are the Objectors?</i> Objectors to any new system are always
found, and are not lacking in the case of shellfish culture. These
would immediately raise the cry that the public is being deprived of
its rights. To-day the public has fewer rights than ever. The present
law causes class distinctions, and a few are benefited at the expense of
the public. The industrious fisherman suffers because a few of the
worthless, unenterprising class, who have no energy, do not wish others
to succeed where they cannot. In every seacoast town in Massachusetts
the more enlightened fishermen see clearly that the only way to preserve
the shellfisheries is to <i>cultivate the barren areas</i>.</p>

<p>Hon. B. F. Wood, in his report of the shellfisheries of New York, in
1906, clearly states the case.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is, unfortunately, in some of the towns and villages upon our coast
an unprogressive element, composed of those who prefer to reap where they
have not sown; who rely upon what they term their "natural right" to rake
where they may choose in the public waters. They deplete, but do not build
up. They think because it may be possible to go out upon the waters for a
few hours in the twenty-four (when the tide serves) and dig a half peck of
shellfish, that it is sufficient reason why such lands should not be leased by
the State to private planters. It might as well be said that it is wrong for
the government to grant homestead farms to settlers, because a few blackberries
might be plucked upon the lands by any who cared to look for them.</p></div>

<p>The following is taken from the report of the Massachusetts Commissioners
on Fisheries and Game for 1906:<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are at least four distinct classes within our Commonwealth, each
of which either derive direct benefits from the mollusk fisheries of our
coast, or are indirectly benefited by the products of the flats:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The general public,&mdash;the consumers, who ultimately pay the cost,
who may either buy the joint product of the labor and capital invested
in taking and distributing the shellfish from either natural or artificial
beds, or who may dig shellfish for food or bait purposes for their own
or family use.</p>

<p>(2) The capitalist, who seeks a productive investment for money or
brains, or both. Under present laws, such are practically restricted to
<i>distribution</i> of shellfish, except in the case of the oyster, where capital may
be employed for <i>production</i> as well,&mdash;an obvious advantage both to capital
and to the public.</p>

<p>(3) The fishermen, who, either as a permanent or temporary vocation,
market the natural yield of the waters; or, as in the case of the shellfisheries,
may with a little capital increase the natural yield and availability by
cultivating an area of the tidal flats after the manner of a garden.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
<p>(4) The owners of the land adjacent to the flats, who are under the present
laws often subjected to loss or annoyance, or even positive discomfort,
by inability to safeguard their proper rights to a certain degree of freedom
from intruders and from damage to bathing or boating facilities, which
constitute a definite portion of the value of shore property.</p>

<p>All of these classes would be directly benefited by just laws, which would
encourage and safeguard all well-advised projects for artificial cultivation
of the tidal flats, and would deal justly and intelligently with the various
coincident and conflicting rights of the fishermen, owners of shore property,
bathers and other seekers of pleasure, recreation or profit, boatmen,
and all others who hold public and private rights and concessions.</p>

<p>That any one class should claim exclusive "natural valid rights," over
any other class, to the shellfish products of the shores, which the law states
expressly are the property of "the people," is as absurd as to claim that any
class had exclusive natural rights to wild strawberries, raspberries, cranberries
or other wild fruits, and that therefore the land upon which these
grew could not be used for the purpose of increasing the yield of these
fruits. This becomes the more absurd from the fact that the wild fruits
pass to the owner of the title of the land, while the shellfish are specifically
exempted, and remain the property of the public.</p>

<p>The class most benefited by improved laws would be the fishermen, who
would profit by better wages through the increased quantity of shellfish they
could dig per hour, by a better market and by better prices, for the reason
that the control of the output would secure regularity of supply. Moreover,
when the market was unfavorable the shellfish could be kept in the
beds with a reasonable certainty of finding them there when wanted, and
with the added advantage of an increased volume by growth during the
interval, together with the avoidance of cold-storage charges. Thus the diggers
could be certain of securing a supply at almost any stage of the
tide and in all but the most inclement weather, through a knowledge of
"where to dig;" moreover, there would be a complete elimination of the
reasoning which is now so prolific of ill feelings and so wasteful of the
shellfish, viz., the incentive of "getting there ahead of the other fellow."</p></div>

<p><i>B.</i> All the shellfish laws should be revised, to secure a unity and
clearness which should render graft, unfairness and avoidable economic
loss impossible, and be replaced with a code of fair, intelligent
and forceful laws, which would not only permit the advancement of the
shellfish industry through the individual efforts of the progressive shellfishermen,
but also protect the rights of the general public.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> The majority of the shellfish laws of the State are enacted by
the individual towns. In 1880 the State first officially granted to each
town the exclusive right to control and regulate its own shellfisheries,
as provided under section 68 of chapter 91 of the Public Statutes. This
was slightly modified by the Acts of 1889 and 1892 to read as follows
(now section 85 of chapter 91 of the Revised Laws):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Section 85.</span> The mayor and aldermen of cities and the selectmen of
towns, if so instructed by their cities and towns, may, except as provided in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the two preceding sections, control, regulate or prohibit the taking of eels,
clams, quahaugs and scallops within the same; and may grant permits prescribing
the times and methods of taking eels and such shellfish within such
cities and towns and make such other regulations in regard to said fisheries
as they may deem expedient. But an inhabitant of the commonwealth, without
such permit, may take eels and the shellfish above-named for his own
family use from the waters of his own or any other city or town, and may
take from the waters of his own city or town any of such shellfish for bait,
not exceeding three bushels, including shells, in any one day, subject to the
general rules of the mayor and aldermen and selectmen, respectively, as to
the times and methods of taking such fish. The provisions of this section
shall not authorize the taking of fish in violation of the provisions of sections
forty-four and forty-five. Whoever takes any eels or any of said
shellfish without such permit, and in violation of the provisions of this section,
shall forfeit not less than three nor more than fifty dollars.</p></div>

<p>Responsibility has thus been transferred from the State to the towns,
and they alone, through their incompetence and neglect, are to blame
for the decline of the shellfisheries. The town laws are miniature copies
of the worst features of the State laws. While a few towns have succeeded
in enacting fairly good laws, the majority have either passed no
shellfish regulations at all, or made matters worse by unintelligent and
harmful laws. It is time that a unified system of competent by-laws
were enacted and enforced in every town.</p>

<p>The ill-advised features which characterize the present town laws are
numerous, and are best considered under the following headings:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) <i>Unintelligent Laws.</i>&mdash;One of the worst features of our town
shellfish laws is their extreme unfitness. Numerous laws which are absolutely
useless for the regulation and improvement of these industries
have been made by towns, through men who knew nothing about the
shellfisheries. These laws were made without any regard for the practical
or biological conditions underlying the shellfish industry. It is to
be expected that laws from such a source would often be ill-advised
and unintelligent, but under the present system it cannot be avoided.
Until sufficient knowledge of the habits and growth of shellfish is acquired
by the authorities of State and town, Massachusetts can never
expect to have intelligent and profitable shellfish laws. While the majority
of these unintelligent laws do no harm, there are some that work
hardship to the fishermen and are an injury to the shellfisheries.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Unfairness; Town Politics.</i>&mdash;Town politics offers many chances
for unscrupulous discrimination in the shellfish laws. Here we find one
class of fishermen benefiting by legislation at the expense of the other,
as in the case of the quahaugers <i>v.</i> oystermen. In one town the oystermen
will have the upper hand; in another, the quahaugers. In every
case there is unfair discrimination, and a resultant financial loss to
both parties. The waters of Massachusetts are large enough for both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
industries, and every man should have a "square deal," which is frequently
lacking under the present r&eacute;gime.</p>

<p>Besides party discrimination, there is discrimination against certain
individuals, as illustrated in giving oyster grants. Town politics plays a
distressing part here. Favoritism is repeatedly shown, and unfairness
results. All this shows the unpopularity and impracticability of such
regulations and the method of making them.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Present Chaotic State.</i>&mdash;The present town laws are in a chaotic
condition, which it is almost impossible to simplify. No one knows
the laws, there is merely a vague impression that such have existed.
Even the selectmen themselves, often new to the office and unacquainted
with the shellfisheries, know little about the accumulated shellfish laws
of the past years, and find it impossible to comprehend them. The only
remedy is to wipe out all the old and replace them with unified new
laws.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Unsystematic Laws.</i>&mdash;The present laws are unsystematized.
Each town has its own methods, good and bad, and the result is a
heterogeneous mixture. Often there are two or three laws where one
would definitely serve. To do absolute justice there should be a definite
system, with laws elastic enough to satisfy the needs of all.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Nonenforcement.</i>&mdash;The worst feature of allowing town control of
the shellfisheries is the nonenforcement of the laws already passed. We
find in many towns that good by-laws have been made, but from inattention
and lack of money these have never been enforced and have
become practically nonexistent. The 1&frac12;-inch quahaug law of several
towns is an instance of this. In but one town in the State, Edgartown,
is any effort made to enforce this excellent town by-law, although several
of the other towns have passed the same. The proper enforcement
of laws is as important as the making, as a law might as well not be
made if not properly enforced. The only way that this can be remedied
is either to take the control completely out of the hands of the town, or
else have a supervisory body which would force the town to look after
violators.</p>

<p>Besides the town by-laws there are other evils which result from the
present system of town control.</p>

<p>II. <i>Lack of Protection in Oyster Industry.</i>&mdash;In no case is the management
by towns more inefficient and confusing than in the case of
the oyster industry. As this subject will be taken up in the oyster report
which follows, it is only necessary here to state that there is great
need of a proper survey of grants, fair laws, systematic methods, etc.
Protection is necessary for the success of any industry, and is especially
needed for the oyster industry. The oyster industry of Massachusetts
will never become important until adequate protection is guaranteed to
the planters. Under the present system, uncertainty rather than protection
is the result.</p>

<p>III. <i>Town Jealousy.</i>&mdash;The evil of town jealousy, whereby one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
town forbids its shellfisheries to the inhabitant of neighboring towns,
is to-day an important factor. It is fair that a town which improves
its own shellfisheries should not be interfered with by a town which
has allowed its shellfisheries to decline. While this is true perhaps
of the clam, quahaug and oyster, it does not hold true of the scallop.
The result of this close-fisted policy has resulted in the past in a great
loss in the scallop industry. The town law in regard to scallops is all
wrong. The scallop fisheries should be open to all the State, and no
one town should "hog the fishing," and leave thousands of bushels to
die from their dog-in-the-manger attitude.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Sectional Jealousy.</i>&mdash;Another evil, which in the past has been
prominent, but is becoming less and less as the years go by, is the
jealousy of the north shore <i>v.</i> the south shore, Cape Cod <i>v.</i> Cape Ann.
In the past this has been a stumbling block against any advance, as any
plan initiated on the south shore would be opposed from sheer prejudice
by the north shore representatives, and <i>vice versa</i>. The cry of "entering
wedge" has been raised again and again whenever any bill was introduced
for the good of the shellfisheries by either party. Merely for
political reasons good legislation has been defeated. However, the last
few years have shown a decided change. The jealous feeling has in a
large measure subsided; the shellfisheries need intelligent consideration,
and all parties realize that united effort is necessary to insure the future
of these industries.</p>

<p>V. <i>Quahaugers</i> v. <i>Oystermen</i>.&mdash;On the south shore the worst evil
which at present exists is the interclass rivalry between the quahaugers
and oystermen. This has caused much harm to both parties, through
expensive lawsuits, economic loss, uncertainty of a livelihood, as well as
retarding the proper development of both industries.</p>

<p>VI. <i>Waste of Competition.</i>&mdash;At the present day the utilization of
waste products in all industries is becoming more and more important.
In this age material which was considered useless by our forefathers
is made to play its part in the economic world. Through science industrial
waste of competition is being gradually reduced to a minimum,
although in any business which deals with perishable commodities, such
as fish, fruit, etc., there is bound to be a certain amount of loss.</p>

<p>Under the present system the shellfisheries suffer from the effects of
waste resulting from competition. Both the fisherman and the consumer
feel the effects of this, in different ways,&mdash;the fisherman through
poor market returns, the consumer through poor service. As long as
the shellfisheries are free to all, there is bound to be that scramble to
get ahead of "the other fellow," which not only results in the destructive
waste of the actual catch, but also causes a "glutted" market,
which gives a low return to the fisherman. Thousands of dollars are
thus lost each year by the fishermen, who are forced to keep shipping
their shellfish, often to perish in the market, merely because the present
system invites ruthless competition. The fishermen in this respect alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
should be the first to desire a new system, which would give to each a
shellfish farm and the privilege of selecting his market.</p>

<p>VII. At the present moment there are two evils which demand
attention, and which can be lessened by the passage of two simple
laws:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) During the past three years many thousands of bushels of
quahaugs under 1&frac12; inches have been shipped out of the State, merely
passing into the hands of New York oystermen, who replanted, reaping
in one year a harvest of at least five bushels to every one "bedded."
Through the inactivity of town control, the incentive to get ahead of
the other fellow and the ignorance that they are wasting their own
substance have caused many quahaugers in the past to do this at many
places.</p>

<p>The 1&frac12;-inch quahaug law has been for years a law for many towns
in the State. It has been practically a dead letter in all but Edgartown,
where it is enforced thoroughly. There should be a State law restricting
the size of the quahaugs taken.</p>

<p>(2) The enforcement of a 1&frac12;-inch clam law, especially in the towns
of Fall River and Swansea, where the digging has reduced the clams
to a small size, likewise deserves immediate attention.</p>

<p>All the present evils have each contributed their share toward the
ruin of the shellfisheries, and can be best summed up under one head,
<i>i.e.</i>, the abuse of nature. All the above evils have either directly or
indirectly worked towards this end. This "abuse of nature" has resulted
in several ways: (1) indiscriminate fishing, restricted by no laws,
augmented by unwise laws; (2) overfishing in certain localities until
the supply is exhausted, as, among other instances, with the Essex
clam flats and the natural oyster beds of the Weweantit River; (3)
exploiting and wasting the natural resources, so that nature cannot
repair the inroads. Nature cannot cope with despoiling man,&mdash;man
must assist nature.</p>

<p>In the past there has been much feeling, especially among the clammers
of the north shore, against the Fish and Game Commission. It
therefore is necessary to correct a mistaken impression, which has
arisen among the clammers, that "the State is going to take the clam
flats away from us." This idea is on the face of it absurd. The Massachusetts
Fish and Game Commission is seeking only to have this question
solved in such a manner as to yield the most satisfactory results for
the public good. At the present time it would be highly undesirable to
take the complete control of the shellfisheries from any town, as long as
that town shows itself capable of regulating them wisely. At the present
day but few towns show any signs of this. What is necessary and
desirable is to have an intelligent supervisory body, with power to compel
each town to take proper care of its shellfisheries. It is advisable
that there be a central power, co-operating with the town control in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
matters pertaining to the shellfisheries, whether it be regulations or the
restocking of barren areas. A board of arbitration, a committee of
appeal for any grievance under the town control, and a commission
that would act for the interests of the whole State, are what is most
desirable at the present time. Such an arrangement would not be
changing radically the present system of town control, but it would
free it from its existing evils, place it on a firm and just basis, and give
the shellfisheries a chance for improvement.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Fisherman and Laws.</span></h3>

<p>The fisherman of to-day, though nominally his own master, is in
reality subject to the demands of the market. To gain a living he is
forced to work in all kinds of weather, at cold, disagreeable work.
Under the present system he is oppressed by useless special town laws,
which merely increase his daily labors without benefiting the fishery in
the least. A few good laws only are necessary for the shellfisheries. It
is time that the fisherman, one of the great factors in the commercial
supremacy of Massachusetts, should be freed from all unnecessary
burdens through a new system of satisfactory laws.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Remedy.</span></h3>

<p>In spite of all the existing evils of the town shellfisheries, the outlook
is far from hopeless. To-day the shellfisheries of Massachusetts, owing
to great natural resources, are as good or better than those of any
other coast States, and only await development under proper methods
to ensure a bright future. The Commissioners on Fisheries and Game
can only point the way of reform; the result lies in the hands of the
intelligent voters of this Commonwealth, whose action decides the
future success or failure of the shellfisheries. It should be the object
of every thinking voter, whether he be fisherman or consumer, to see
that the right action be taken in regard to the shellfisheries.</p>

<p>As shown in the preceding pages of this report, the attempted remedy
has been based upon the false economic basis of attempting to check
the demand by prohibiting digging for certain periods (closed seasons),
limiting the amount to be legally dug by any one person, etc. It would
be quite as logical for a town or city to prohibit by by-laws the use or
digging of potatoes or any other food crop, when the supply was short,
rather than to attempt to <i>increase</i> the supply. An increasing demand
cannot be checked by any such ill-advised measures, but can be met only
by a corresponding increase in the natural production. The only remedy
that can be applied successfully is shellfish culture, which means
the utilizing of thousands of acres of barren shore area for the planting
of farms which will furnish harvests of shellfish. In this way the
latent potentialities of nature, which it is criminal to neglect, will be
utilized for the good of the entire population of the State.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">


<p>We learn from the dictionaries that a farm is defined to be a tract of
land under one control, devoted to agriculture, etc.; and that agriculture is
the cultivation of the soil for food products or other useful or valuable
growths. All this is very familiar knowledge, as applied to the dry land;
but that there may fairly be brought within these definitions the operations
of an industry in which lands covered by the salt waters of our bays and
harbors are tilled, cultivated, raked, harrowed and planted with seedling
bivalves, and harvests of a valuable product garnered, constituting a superb
food for the masses, is less familiar, and to many may seem quite astonishing.
It is within a comparatively few years that this unique style of farming
has had its growth and development, until now many thousands of acres
of land under water have been carefully surveyed, and the boundaries
marked by buoys and stakes.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></div>

<p>To bring the shellfisheries of Massachusetts to their maximum production
will take years, but within five years the production can be
nearly doubled, if work in the right direction is begun at once. Patience
will be required to overcome the obstacles which must be met,
and the change must necessarily be gradual.</p>

<p>Every year the difficulties of reform increase. Owing to a steadily
increasing demand, the natural supply is becoming smaller, and consequently
the difficulty of increasing it becomes so much the harder.
Soon the line of possibility will be crossed, and the shellfisheries will
become an industry of the past. A few shellfish will always remain,
but as an important industry, the shellfisheries, if no remedy is applied,
in twenty-five years will be commercially extinct. While there is
still time, let action be taken.</p>

<p>The utilization of the barren shellfish areas, wise laws, good regulations
and systematic methods of culture are necessary, in order to
obtain the maximum production from these sea farms. The sea farm
possesses one advantage over the ordinary farm,&mdash;the soil never becomes
exhausted, as the shellfish derive their sustenance from the
water, utilizing indirectly the waste nitrates of the land. To do this it
is necessary that shellfish culture be at once begun, either by individuals
or by towns.</p>

<p>Three methods of shellfish culture offer ways of approach towards
the utilization of the waste areas:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) To leave the matter wholly in the hands of the town. This is
the poorest way, as has been shown in the past. Unless the town officials
were well informed about the shellfisheries, it would be an absurd
farce to entrust the future of this important industry wholly in their
hands.</p>

<p>(2) Place all power with the State, instead of with the town.
Have a unified and simplified system, whereby shellfish farms and
grants can be leased by the individuals. This plan, much better than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the first, and possibly the final solution, is, however, not practical of
application to the existing conditions. Later, when these conditions
are removed, it may prove the best solution of the problem.</p>

<p>(3) The present system of town control to remain. The appointment
of the Fish and Game Commission, or a similar commission, to
have complete advisory power over the towns, and power to force each
town to properly protect its shellfish. A State law would be passed,
legalizing grants to individuals and dividing the flats into two equal
parts,&mdash;public and private. The leasing of grants would be in the
hands of the town authorities, but subject to appeal for any grievance
to the Fish and Game Commission.</p>

<p>In the chapter relating to each shellfish will be given the practical
methods of cultivation for reclaiming the waste areas. These methods
have been proved by the experimental work of this commission, the
results of which may be published in a subsequent scientific report upon
the shellfish. The commission has definitely shown that shellfish culture
in Massachusetts is a possibility, and, moreover, a remunerative possibility.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Who Would Benefit?</span></h3>

<p>(1) Under the proposed system of practical shellfish culture, many
classes of people would be benefited. The person who would be primarily
benefited is the fisherman. In the following ways the condition of
the industrious fisherman would be bettered: (<i>a</i>) his work would be
steady, not uncertain; (<i>b</i>) he would know his exact annual income, and
could govern his living expenses accordingly; (<i>c</i>) he would receive more
money, with less hardship; (<i>d</i>) he would ensure steady market returns,
which under the present system are very uncertain; (e) he would be his
own master, and not forced to work for poor pay, under the stress of
wasteful competition.</p>

<p>(2) The shellfisheries are not for any particular class, but should benefit
all, and any improvement in the industry affects all people. A second
class would also be benefited by an increase in the shellfish
industries. This class can be divided into two groups: (<i>a</i>) those directly
influenced; (<i>b</i>) those indirectly. In the first group are the middlemen,&mdash;dealers.
By an increased trade, more firms enter the business, more
men are hired, etc. Comprising the second group are teamsters, coopers,
shop owners, sailors, transportation lines,&mdash;an indefinite list, which
would be indirectly benefited by an increase in the shellfish industry.</p>

<p>(3) Thirdly, the consumer would receive the benefit of improved
quality of goods, reasonable prices, etc. Through increased transportation
facilities the inland consumer would have the pleasure of
partaking of sea food, and what were once the luxuries of the rich could
be had by all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Capital.</span></h3>

<p>Capital is needed for the best success of any business. In a broad
sense, the tools, implements, etc., of the shellfisherman are capital. In
the future, if the shellfisheries are to become a great industry, money
as working capital is indispensable. Blind objection to the employment
of capital on the part of the fishermen works against the best
interests of the shellfisheries.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Shellfish Monopoly.</span></h3>

<p>For years the fishermen have feared that the shellfisheries would fall
into the hands of a few companies or trusts, and the individual fisherman
thereby lose his independence. As the present age tends toward
the formation of monopolies in all business, the fears of the fishermen
are not altogether groundless in this respect; nevertheless, while there
are certain chances of monopoly in the shellfisheries, these chances are
very small. In the first place, a monopoly of a raw edible product,
such as shellfish, is hardly possible. Never can it be possible for any
one company to control all or the majority of a shellfish supply, which
possesses unlimited possibilities of expansion.</p>

<p>Secondly, there are but two ways in which a monopoly of the shellfisheries
can be obtained: one is the control of the market by buying
up all the shellfish,&mdash;a thing far easier under the present conditions;
the other, by buying through contract the rights of the individual
planters. The success of such an enterprise would depend wholly
upon the personnel of the shellfishermen, and such a result could never
become possible if each shellfisherman would refuse to sell his rights.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Summary.</span></h3>

<p>This survey has shown (1) that the shellfisheries have declined (an
established fact); (2) that the causes of the decline are overfishing
and unwise laws; (3) that the remedy is, not to check the demand, as
has been previously attempted, but to increase the production by the
utilization of vast areas of barren flats, which have been experimentally
proved capable of yielding a great harvest; (4) that the present
chaotic laws render this impossible; (5) that there is a need of reform,
or else the shellfisheries will soon disappear; (6) that the first step is
the removal of these laws to permit the application of proper cultural
methods.</p>

<h2><a name="Quahaug_Venus_mercenaria" id="Quahaug_Venus_mercenaria"><span class="smcap">Quahaug</span> (<i>Venus mercenaria</i>).</a></h2>


<p>Inhabiting common waters with the scallop, the northern range of
the quahaug (the hard-shell clam or "little neck") in Massachusetts is
Plymouth. Commercially it is found both on the north and south
side of Cape Cod and in Buzzards Bay, the principal fisheries
being at Wellfleet, Orleans, Edgartown, Nantucket and in Buzzards Bay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>The quahaug, while essentially a southern and warm-water form,
being found in the United States along the Atlantic seacoast as far
south as the Gulf of Mexico, practically reaches its northern range in
Massachusetts. In a few sheltered bays on the Maine coast quahaugs
are sometimes found, but in small quantities. However, at Prince
Edward Island there is said to be an abundance.</p>

<p>Along the coast of Massachusetts north of Boston very few quahaugs
are found, although they were formerly taken near Salem. The black
quahaug (<i>Cyprina islandica</i>), so called from its dark epidermis, is often
caught in the trawls, but this is a deep-sea form, and by no means a
true quahaug. In Essex and Ipswich rivers and on Plum Island experimental
beds have shown that quahaugs grow in these waters, but no
spawn has yet been noticed, though ripe eggs were developed in the
planted quahaugs. Owing to the swift currents, which carry the
spawn perhaps for miles, it is impossible to determine accurately
whether any set has taken place.</p>

<p>During the past three years, as outlined by chapter 78, Resolves of
1905, the Fish and Game Commission has conducted a series of experiments
upon the quahaug, designated to furnish sufficient data concerning
the growth of this mollusk under a variety of conditions, to demonstrate
the possibilities and value of practical quahaug farming. The results of
these investigations upon the life, habits and culture of the quahaug
are to be published in a later scientific report. It is necessary here to
say that all statements in this report concerning the growth and culture
of quahaugs have been proved by experiments, the results of which are
on file at the office of the department of fisheries and game.</p>

<p>It is the object of this report to present both to the fishermen and
consumers (1) actual statistical figures of the industry of the State for
1907; (2) a biological survey of the quahauging areas, outlined by
maps and descriptions; (3) a description of the industry. This survey
should furnish a basis for determining any decline or advance in the
quahaug industry of the future, as well as affording comparison with
the United States Fish Commission survey of 1879, made by Ernest
Ingersoll.</p>

<p>Massachusetts, situated at the northern limit of the quahaug industry
of the United States, is handicapped in comparison with other States,
as only the southern waters of the State are given to this industry.
Nevertheless, though possessing only a partial industry, Massachusetts
ranks the fourth State in quahaug production, according to the 1906
report of the United States Fish Commission.</p>

<p>The same natural conditions which suit so well the shallow-water
scallop are also adapted to the growth of the quahaug. In nearly all
the sheltered bays, inlets and rivers of the southern coast of Massachusetts
the quahaug can be found in varying abundance. Technically,
there is more territory which admits the possibility of quahaug growth
than of any other shellfish. The bathymetric range of the quahaug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
is extensive, as the quahaug is raked in all depths of water up to 50
feet. In spite of the vast territory nature has provided for the quahaug
in the waters of Massachusetts, the commercial fishery is found only
in small parts of this large area. Scattered quahaugs are found over
the rest of the area, but in paying quantities only in limited places.</p>

<p>The possibilities of developing this great natural tract of quahaug
ground are especially alluring,&mdash;far more so than any of the other
shellfisheries. The quahaug has a greater area, greater possible expansion
and a more profitable market. Nature has equipped southern
Massachusetts with numerous bays with remarkable facilities for the
production of quahaugs; it only remains for man to make the most of
these.</p>

<p><i>Method of Work.</i>&mdash;The method of work used in preparing this portion
of the report varied but little from that relating to the other shellfish,
though several features made it harder to obtain accurate information.
There is a more general obscurity about the history of the quahaug
than about any of the other shellfish, even though the quahaug industry
is commercially the youngest of all. This is due, perhaps, to the gradual
rise of the industry through the discovery of new territory. The only
historical record obtainable is E. Ingersoll's report on the quahaug, in
1879, in which he deals briefly with the industry in Massachusetts.
Town records help but little in determining the history of the industry,
as only of late years have the towns required the taking of permits.</p>

<p>In making the biological survey, the difficulty arises of defining what
constitutes quahaug ground, since scattering quahaugs are found over
vast territories, but only limited areas are commercially productive. The
estimates of the quahaugers, both historically and in regard to production
and areas, are often erroneous and vary greatly. By the use of
market reports, express shipments, estimates of dealers, estimates of
several reliable quahaugers, and all methods at our command, the facts
of the industry were compiled and errors eliminated as far as possible.
The home consumption is hard to determine, and is merely an estimate.
The area of the quahaug territory was plotted on the map, and
calculations made from the plots. Whenever personal inspection was
not possible, as in Falmouth, the estimates of several quahaugers were
taken.</p>


<h3><i>Results.</i></h3>

<p>1. <i>Is the Quahaug Fishery declining?</i>&mdash;The decline of the quahaug
fishery is well recognized. Even the production figures, which, when
stimulated by high prices, usually give a deceptive appearance of prosperity
to a declining industry, since more men enter the fishery, show
a decline in the last few years. When such a point is reached,&mdash;when,
in spite of higher prices and more men, the annual production
becomes less and less,&mdash;not many years will pass before the industry
will collapse completely.</p>

<p>Increased prices show either an increase in demand or a falling off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
of the supply. Both are perhaps true of the quahaug industry. The
demand, especially for "little necks," has been steadily on the increase,
and a broad inland market is gradually opening, since the quahaug is
capable of long transportation without perishing. So the increased
prices are a sign of the diminution of the supply, as well as of an increased
demand, the indeterminable factor being what ratio the one bears
to the other.</p>

<p>The only way to determine accurately the decline in the natural supply
is to compare the amount the average quahauger could dig ten or
twenty years ago with the amount dug to-day. Even this comparison
is unfair, as the better rakes, improved methods, etc., of the present
time tend to increase the daily yield of the quahauger.</p>

<p>This decline can best be shown by taking special localities:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) <i>Buzzards Bay.</i>&mdash;The quahaug industry in Buzzards Bay has
shown a great decline in the past ten to twenty years, and the industry
is now at a low ebb, especially in the towns of Marion and Mattapoisett.
Wareham, Bourne and Fairhaven still manage to ship about
27,000 bushels annually, employing over 200 men; but this is hardly up
to their former standard. To-day at Wareham the daily catch per man
is one-fifth of what it was twenty years ago; in 1887 a man could dig
5 bushels to a catch of 1 bushel now. Buzzards Bay perhaps has shown
the greatest quahaug decline.</p>

<p>(2) <i>South Side of Cape Cod.</i>&mdash;While not so marked a decline has
taken place as in Buzzards Bay, every quahauger agrees that the industry
is gradually failing. In Bass River, at Hyannis, and in Chatham,
there is a marked decrease, while at Cotuit and Osterville the
industry has remained stationary.</p>

<p>(3) <i>North Side of Cape Cod.</i>&mdash;The best quahaug fishery of Massachusetts,
except at Edgartown, is found on the north side of Cape Cod,
in the towns of Wellfleet, Eastham and Orleans. These three towns
give an annual yield of 75,000 bushels. Only about fifteen years old
commercially, the industry has passed its prime and is on the decline.
This decline is shown both by production figures and by the gradual
moving to deeper water. As the quahaugs were thinned out in shallow
water, the fishermen moved farther and farther out, using long rakes,
until 60-foot rakes are now used at a depth of 50 feet. Probably the
60-foot limit will never be exceeded, unless a method of dredging is
devised; and it will be only a question of years when the industry will
become extinct.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Nantucket.</i>&mdash;The industry here has generally declined, though
in the last few years there has been a slight increase in production.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Edgartown.</i>&mdash;The quahaug industry at Edgartown has declined
little, if any, while the fishery has been carried on for many years. The
natural resources have not been seriously impaired, owing to the efficient
town management; and Edgartown can be congratulated on being
the only town in the State that can boast of a protected industry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>Although the quahaug industry has not openly shown the tendency
to decline that the soft clam has manifested in southern Massachusetts,
the danger is nevertheless very great, and the disaster would be far
worse. The fishermen of Cape Cod realize that the clam industry has
practically gone; but they are blind to the fact that a far more important
one&mdash;the quahaug industry&mdash;is in as grave danger, and only
when it is too late will they wake to a realization of the situation.</p>

<p>The clam industry on Cape Cod and Buzzards Bay will never assume
the importance it possesses on the north shore, owing to lack of extensive
flats. Rather the quahaug industry is the main shellfish industry
of the south shore, as it is more valuable, more important, and capable
of vast expansion. The development of the quahaug industry should
bring many hundred thousand dollars to Cape Cod.</p>

<p>II. <i>Causes of the Decline.</i>&mdash;The direct cause is overfishing. The
quahaug is hardy, little harmed by climatic changes, and has but few
natural enemies. Man alone has caused the decline of the natural
supply. Not satisfied with taking the mediums and large quahaugs,
but spurred on by the high prices offered for the "little neck," the
quahaug fisherman has cleaned up everything he can get, and the natural
supply has suffered greatly. If the market demands the capture of the
"little neck," it is necessary to leave the large quahaugs as "spawners."
At the present time, by the capture of both the industry is being ruined.</p>


<h3><i>The Remedy.</i>&mdash;<i>Quahaug Farming.</i></h3>

<p>There is only <i>one way</i> in which the present decline can be checked,
and that is, to increase the natural supply by cultural methods to meet
the demands of the market. The only way to accomplish this increase
is to plant and raise quahaugs,&mdash;in fact, have a system of <i>quahaug
farming</i> for the whole south shore of Massachusetts. In considering
quahaug farming, many questions naturally arise: (1) Is quahaug
farming an established fact, or a mere theory? (2) Possibilities of
quahaug farming. (3) What is the growth of the quahaug, and how
long does it take to raise a crop? (4) What is the value of a quahaug
farm? (5) What benefits would the quahaug industry receive from
such a system?</p>

<p>(1) <i>Quahaug Farming an Established Fact,&mdash;not a Theory.</i>&mdash;It is
not the object of this report to go into a scientific treatise upon experiments
in quahaug culture. For the past three years the Commission
on Fisheries and Game has been conducting experiments upon the
growth and culture of quahaugs, the results of which will be published
in a subsequent report. These experiments have shown that quahaug
farming is no theory, but an established fact, and that, if taken up, it
will make the quahaug fishery the most important shellfish industry
of the State. These experiments, consisting of small beds one one-thousandth
of an acre in area, were located at different places along
the coast. Various conditions in regard to food, current, tide, soil, etc.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
were tested. The results from nearly every bed were excellent, and
showed the ease of culture and the great profit which would result if
larger areas were thus worked.</p>

<p>The results obtained from the experiments of the commission alone
are sufficient to prove the practicability of quahaug farming, even if
there were no other proofs. As it is, there have been many tests made
by the oystermen, both outside and inside the State. Some years ago
the oystermen near New York realized the possibilities of raising quahaugs
on their oyster grants, and to-day Massachusetts ships many
barrels of "seed" quahaugs out of the State to these far-sighted business
men, who reap large returns by replanting these small "little
necks." The Massachusetts oystermen have not been slow to realize
the large returns afforded by quahaug culture, and some have planted
many bushels of the "seed," thus turning their grants into partial
quahaug farms. These men have proved that this style of farming is
practical, and that as a money-making proposition the quahaug is far
ahead of the oyster.</p>

<p>As affairs exist to-day in Massachusetts, a few men alone have the
privilege of raising quahaugs, while the rest stand idle. Theoretically
and legally, no one has the right to plant and raise quahaugs in the
State; but practically and secretly it is done with great success. Who
can blame the oysterman for raising quahaugs with his oysters, in
view of the fast-declining quahaug industry? Rather by so doing he
is helping perpetuate the natural supply. The objection to this present
system of secret quahaug farming is its unfairness. A few men
are enjoying the privileges that many others should likewise enjoy.
There is plenty of room, and quahaug farming might as well be carried
on openly, to the benefit of all.</p>

<p>While the oystermen have made a move toward general quahaug farming,
and have shown the great possibilities that this system possesses,
the quahaugers have also exhibited a tendency in a similar direction.
The originators of the town law in Eastham, Orleans and Wellfleet,
which provides for the leasing of 5,625 square feet of flat for bedding
the catch, and thus makes possible the advantage of a favorable market,
probably did not imagine that this was the first great step on the part
of the quahaugers towards shellfish farming. The success of this scheme
has here opened the eyes of the intelligent quahaugers to the even
better possibilities of quahaug culture, and any well-devised scheme
of shellfish farming will be favorably received.</p>

<p>The main impulse that makes people turn to quahaug culture is the
steady decline of the industry, especially during the last few years. In
the previous pages of this report there have been shown: (1) the
actuality of the decline; (2) the causes of this decline. The proof of
the decline is so generally apparent that it has created a popular demand
for a fair system of quahaug farming, to check the diminution
of the present supply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) <i>Possibilities of Quahaug Farming.</i>&mdash;The quahaug has a wide
range; it is found in all depths of water, from high tide line to sixty
feet, and in various kinds of mud and sand bottom. This natural
adaptability gives the quahaug a wider area than any other shellfish,
as it will live in nearly any bottom, although the rate of growth depends
essentially upon its location in respect to current. This permits
the utilization of vast areas which to-day are unproductive, and which
can all be made into profitable quahaug farms. Quahaugs will grow
on thousands of acres of flats, such as the Common Flats of Chatham,
if they are planted. There are indefinite possibilities of expansion in
quahaug farming through the reclamation of this unproductive sea
bottom.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Rate of Growth of Quahaug.</i>&mdash;The rate of growth of the quahaug
varies greatly in regard to its location in respect to the current.
The quahaugs which have the better current or circulation of water
show the faster growth. The fastest growth recorded by the experiments
of the Department on Fisheries and Game was a gain of 1 inch
a year; <i>i.e.</i>, 1&frac12;-inch quahaugs attained in one year a length of 2&frac12;
inches. The average growth is between &frac12; and &frac34; inch a year, or a
yield of 3 to 5 bushels for every bushel planted, or the return in one
year of $4 for every $1 invested. In the more favorable localities there
would be the enormous gain of $8 for every dollar invested. All this
can be done in six months, as the quahaug grows only during the six
summer months. The above figures are taken from experiments which
have been conducted on Cape Cod, in Buzzards Bay and at Nantucket.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Value of a Quahaug Farm.</i>&mdash;An acre of "little-neck" quahaugs
has a high market value. A conservative estimate of 10 per square foot
gives the yield in one year of 2&frac12;-inch quahaugs as 600 bushels per
acre; This means that 120 bushels of 1&frac34;-inch quahaugs were planted
to the acre. The price paid for the same would be $600, at the high
price of $5 per bushel. The price received for the same, at $3 per
bushel, would bring $1,800, or a gain of $3 for every $1 invested. This
is a conservative estimate on all sides. Quahaugs could be planted
two or three times as thick, seed might be purchased for less money,
more money might be received for private shipments, and faster growth
can be obtained. The only labor necessary is gathering the quahaugs
for market. The quahaug farm requires no such care as the agricultural
farm, and offers far more profit.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Advantage of Quahaug Culture.</i>&mdash;The quahaug is the most
remunerative of any of our shellfish. It possesses several advantages
over the oyster: (1) it is hardier,&mdash;less influenced by climatic conditions;
(2) it has fewer enemies, as it lies protected under the sand;
(3) it possesses a market the whole year; (4) there is more money
for the planter in raising "little necks" than in raising oysters. If
oyster culture has succeeded in Massachusetts, there is no question that,
given a proper chance, quahaug culture can be put on a firm basis, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
made the leading shellfish industry of Massachusetts. The value of
the present quahaug industry lies chiefly in the production of "little
necks." Under a cultural system of quahaug farms, this could be made
a specialty. Old quahaugs would be kept as "seeders," and "little
necks" alone raised for the market. The advantage of furnishing
"little necks" of uniform size would lead to increased prices; steady
customers would be obtained and certainty of production guaranteed.
All the advantages lie with quahaug farming, as opposed to the present
method of "free-for-all" digging.</p>

<p>The quahaug industry of the future, if put on a cultural basis, will not
only check the decline of a valuable industry, but will increase the present
production many fold. A far larger supply, work for more men
and better prices for the consumer will result.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Spat Collecting.</i>&mdash;The main obstacle that stands in the way of
permanent quahaug culture is a lack of sufficient young "seed" quahaugs.
While several heavy sets have been recorded, the "seed"
quahaugs are never found in vast quantities, as are the young of the
soft clam (<i>Mya arenaria</i>). The set of quahaugs is usually scattering
and slight. A method of spat collecting, <i>i.e.</i>, catching the spawn and
raising the small quahaugs, is alone necessary for the complete success
of quahaug culture. While nothing of practical importance has yet
been found, indications are favorable that some means will be devised
in the next few years, and that quantities of young quahaugs can be
raised. Experiments have already shown that as many as 75 can be
caught per square foot in box spat collectors; but a more practical
method than this must be found to make the business profitable.</p>


<h3><i>The Quahaug Industry.</i></h3>

<p><i>Methods of Capture.</i>&mdash;Several methods of taking quahaugs are in
vogue in Massachusetts, some simple and primitive, others more advanced
and complex, but all modifications of simple raking or digging.
These methods have arisen with the development of the industry, and
record the historical changes in the quahaug fishery, as each new fishery
or separate locality demands some modification of the usual methods.</p>

<p>(1) "<i>Treading.</i>"&mdash;The early settlers in Massachusetts quickly
learned from the Indians the primitive method of "treading" quahaugs,
which required no implements except the hands and feet. The "treader"
catches the quahaug by wading about in the water, feeling for them
with his toes in the soft mud, and then picking them up by hand. Nowhere
in Massachusetts is it used as a method of commercial fishery.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Tidal Flat Fishery.</i>&mdash;Often quahaugs are found on the exposed
tidal flats, where they can sometimes be taken by hand, but more often
with ordinary clam hoes or short rakes. Owing to the scarcity of quahaugs
between the tide lines, this method does not pay for market fishing,
and is only resorted to by people who dig for home consumption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>(3) <i>Tonging.</i>&mdash;In most parts of Buzzards Bay and in a few places
on Cape Cod quahaugs are taken with <i>oyster tongs</i>. This method is
applicable only in water less than 12 feet deep, as the longest tongs
measure but 16 feet. Four sizes of tongs are used, 8, 10, 12 and 16
feet in length. Tonging is carried on in the small coves and inlets,
where there is little if any rough water. A muddy bottom is usually
preferable, as a firm, hard soil increases the labor of manipulating
the tongs, which are used in the same manner as in tonging oysters.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Raking.</i>&mdash;The most universal method of taking quahaugs is with
rakes. This method is used in every quahaug locality in Massachusetts,
each town having its special kind of rake. Four main types of rakes
can be recognized:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>The Digger.</i>&mdash;In some localities, chiefly in Buzzards Bay, the
ordinary potato digger or rake, having four or five long, thin prongs, is
used. Usually it has a back of wire netting, which holds the quahaugs
when caught by the prongs. As the digger has a short handle of 5
feet, it can be used only in shallow water, where the quahauger, wading
in the water, turns out the quahaugs with this narrow rake. This method
yields but a scanty return, and is more often used for home consumption
than for market.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>The Garden Rake.</i>&mdash;The ordinary garden rake, equipped with
a basket back of wire netting, is in more general use in shallow water,
either by wading or from a boat, as it has the advantage of being wider
than the potato digger.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>The Claw Rake.</i>&mdash;This type of rake varies in size, width and
length of handle. It is used chiefly at Nantucket. The usual style has a
handle 6 feet long, while the iron part in the form of a claw or talon
is 10 inches wide, with prongs 1 inch apart. Heavier rakes with longer
handles are sometimes used for deep water, but for shallow water the
usual form is the short-claw rake.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>The Basket Rake.</i>-The greater part of the quahaug production
is taken from deep water, with the basket rake. These rakes have handles
running from 23 to 65 feet in length, according to the depth of
water over the beds. Where the water is of various depths, several
detachable handles of various lengths are used. At the end of these long
handles is a small cross-piece, similar to the cross-piece of a lawn mower;
this enables the quahauger to obtain a strong pull when raking. The
handles are made of strong wood, and are very thin and flexible, not
exceeding 1&frac12; inches in diameter. The price of these handles varies
according to the length, but the average price is about $2. As the long
handles break very easily, great care must be taken in raking.</p>

<p>Three forms of the basket rake are used in Massachusetts. These
rakes vary greatly in form and size, and it is merely a question of
opinion which variety is the best, as all are made on the same general
principle,&mdash;a curved, basket-shaped body, the bottom edge of which
is set with thin steel teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Wellfleet and Chatham Rake.</i>&mdash;This rake is perhaps the most
generally used for all deep-water quahauging on Cape Cod, and finds
favor with all. It consists of an iron framework, forming a curved
bowl, the under edge of which is set with thin steel teeth varying
in length from 2 to 4 inches, though usually 2&frac12;-inch teeth are the
favorite. Formerly these teeth were made of iron, but owing to the
rapid wear it was found necessary to make them of steel. Over
the bowl of this rake, which is strengthened by side and cross pieces
of iron, is fitted a twine net, which, like the net of a scallop dredge,
drags behind the framework. An average rake has from 19 to 21
teeth, and weighs from 15 to 20 pounds.</p>

<p><i>Edgartown Basket Rake.</i>&mdash;The basket rake used at Edgartown and
Nantucket is lighter and somewhat smaller than the Wellfleet rake.
The whole rake, except the teeth, is made of iron. No netting is required,
as thin iron wires 1/3 inch apart encircle lengthwise the whole
basket, preventing the escape of any marketable quahaug, and at the
same time allowing the mud to wash out. This rake has 16 steel teeth,
1&frac12; inches long, fitted at intervals of 1 inch in the bottom scraping bar,
which is 16 inches long; the depth of the basket is about 8 inches. Much
shorter poles, not exceeding 30 feet in length, are used with this rake,
and the whole rake is much lighter. The price of this rake is $7.50,
while the poles cost $1.50.</p>

<p>The third form of basket rake is a cross between the basket and
claw rakes. This rake is used both at Nantucket and on Cape Cod, but
is not so popular as the other types. The basket is formed by the curve
of the prongs, which are held together by two long cross-bars at the top
and bottom of the basket, while the ends are enclosed by short strips
of iron. This rake exemplifies the transition stage between the claw
and basket types, indicating that the basket form was derived from the
former. Handles 20 to 30 feet long are generally used with these rakes.</p>

<p><i>Shallow v. Deep Water Quahauging.</i>&mdash;Two kinds of quahauging
are found in Massachusetts,&mdash;the deep and the shallow water fisheries.
This arbitrary distinction also permits a division of localities in regard
to the principal methods of fishing. Although in all localities there
exists more or less shallow-water fishing, the main quahaug industry of
several towns is the deep-water fishery. In all the Buzzards Bay towns
except Fairhaven and New Bedford the shallow-water fishery prevails;
this is also true of the south side of Cape Cod. On the north side of
Cape Cod the opposite is true, as the quahauging at Wellfleet, Eastham,
Orleans and Brewster is practically all deep-water fishing. At Edgartown
and Nantucket, although there is considerable shallow-water digging,
the deep-water fishery is the more important.</p>

<p>The deep-water fishery is vastly more productive than the shallow-water
industry, furnishing annually 118,500 bushels, compared to
23,227 bushels, or more than 5 times as much. The deep-water fishery,
<i>i.e.</i>, the basket-rake fishery, is the main quahaug fishery of the State,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and each year it is increasing, because of the opening of new beds.
On the other hand, the shallow-water grounds are rapidly becoming
barren from overfishing.</p>

<p>The deep-water quahauging is harder work, requires considerable
capital but has fewer working days. Naturally the earnings from this
fishery should surpass those of the shallow-water industry. The deep-water
quahauger averages from $5 to $8 for a working day, while the
shallow-water fisherman earns only from $2 to $3 per day.</p>

<p><i>Deep-water Quahauging.</i>&mdash;Both power and sail boats are used in
deep-water quahauging, though power is gradually replacing the old
method of sailing, because of its increased efficiency and saving of time.
When the quahaug grounds are reached, the boat is anchored at both
bow and stern, one continuous rope connecting both anchors, which are
from 500 to 600 feet apart, in such a way that the bow of the boat is
always headed against the tide. A sufficient amount of slack is required
for the proper handling of the boat, which can be moved along this
anchor "road" as on a cable, and a large territory raked. The rake
is lowered from the bow of the boat, the length of the handle being
regulated by the depth of the water, and the teeth worked into the sandy
or muddy bottom. The quahauger then takes firm hold of the cross-piece
at the end of the handle, and works the rake back to the stern of
the boat, where it is hauled in and the contents dumped on the culling
board or picked out of the net. In hauling in the net the rake is turned
so that the opening is on top, and the mud and sand is washed out before
it is taken on board. The long pole passes across the boat and
extends into the water on the opposite side when the rake is hauled in.
This process is repeated until the immediate locality becomes unprofitable,
when the boat is shifted along the cable.</p>

<p>The usual time for quahauging is from half ebb to half flood tide,
thus avoiding the extra labor of high-water raking. Deep-water raking
is especially hard labor, and six hours constitute a good day's work.</p>

<p><i>Boats.</i>&mdash;Nearly all kinds of boats are utilized in the quahaug fishery,
and are of all values, from the $10 second-hand skiff to the 38-foot
power seine boat, which costs $1,500. The shallow-water industry requires
but little invested capital. Dories and skiffs are the principal
boats, costing from $10 to $25. Occasionally a sail or power boat
may be used in this fishery. The deep-water industry requires larger and
stronger boats. These are either power or sail boats, often auxiliary
"cats," and their value runs anywhere from $150 to $1,500. The
average price for the sail boats is $250, while the power boats are
assessed at $350. At Orleans several large power seine boats, valued at
about $1,500, are used in the quahaug fishery. These seine boats are
30 to 38 feet over all, have low double cabins, and are run by 8 to 12
horse-power gasolene engines. The ordinary power boats have gasolene
engines from 2 to 6 horse-power. In this way each method of
quahauging has its own boats, which are adapted for its needs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dredging.</i>&mdash;So far as known, dredging is never used in quahauging
in Massachusetts, although it is sometimes used on sea-clam beds. It has
been tried, but without success, chiefly because of the uneven nature of
the bottom. The invention of a suitable dredge is necessary, and there
can be little doubt that in the future, if this difficulty is overcome,
dredging will be used in the quahaug fishery. In 1879 Mr. Ernest
Ingersoll reports in Rhode Island the use of a quahaug dredge similar
in structure to our rake. Evidently this form was never especially
successful, possibly because these dredges could not be dragged by
sail boats.</p>

<p><i>Outfit of a Quahauger.</i>&mdash;The implements and boats used in quahauging
have already been mentioned. The outfit of the average
quahauger in each fishery is here summarized:&mdash;</p>

  </tr>

<p><i>Season.</i>&mdash;The quahaug fishery is essentially a summer fishery, and
little if any is done during the winter. The season in Massachusetts
lasts for seven months, usually starting the last of March or the first
of April, and ending about the first of November. The opening of the
spring season varies several weeks, owing to the severity of the weather;
and the same is true of the closing of the season.</p>

<p>As a rule, the Buzzards Bay industry, where digging is done in the
shallow waters of protected bays and coves, using short rakes and tongs,
has a longer season than the quahaug industry of Cape Cod, where the
fishery is carried on in deep and open waters. With the former, the
cold work and hardship alone force the quahaugers to stop fishing, a
long time after storms and rough weather have brought the latter industry
to an end.</p>

<p>The actual working days of the deep-water quahauger number hardly
over 100 per season, while those of the shallow-water fishermen easily
outnumber 150. The deep-water quahauger's daily earnings are two or
three times the daily wages of the shallow-water quahauger, but the
additional number of working days in part make up this difference.</p>

<p>The quahaug season can be divided arbitrarily into three parts: (1)
spring; (2) summer; (3) fall. The spring season lasts from April 1
to June 15, the summer season from June 15 to September 15, and the
fall season from September 15 to November 1. These seasons are
marked by an increase in the number of quahaugers in the spring and
fall. The men who do summer boating quahaug in the spring before the
summer people arrive, and in the fall after the summer season is over.
The opening of the scallop season, in towns that are fortunate enough
to possess both industries, marks the closing of the quahaug season.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
These two industries join so well, scalloping in the winter and quahauging
in the summer, that a shellfisherman has work practically all
the year.</p>

<p><i>The Principal Markets.</i>&mdash;The principal markets for the sale of
Massachusetts quahaugs are Boston and New York. In 1879 the Boston
market, according to Mr. Ernest Ingersoll, sold comparatively few. At
the present time the Boston market disposes of many thousand bushels
annually, but nevertheless the greater part of the Massachusetts quahaugs
are shipped to New York. This, again, is due to the better market
prices offered by that city. Besides passing through these two main
channels, quahaugs are shipped direct from the coast dealers to various
parts of the country, especially the middle west. This last method
seems to be on the increase, and the future may see a large portion of
the quahaug trade carried on by direct inland shipments.</p>

<p><i>Shipment.</i>&mdash;Quahaugs are shipped either in second-hand sugar or
flour barrels or in bushel bags. The latter method is fast gaining popularity
with the quahaugers and dealers, owing to its cheapness, and is
now steadily used in some localities. When quahaugs are shipped in
barrels, holes are made in the bottom and sides of the barrel, to allow
free circulation of air and to let the water out, while burlap is used
instead of wooden heads.</p>

<p>"<i>Culls.</i>"&mdash;Several culls are made for the market. These vary in
number in different localities and with different firms, but essentially
are modifications of the three "culls" made by the quahaugers: (1)
"little necks;" (2) "sharps;" (3) "blunts." The divisions made by
the firm of A. D. Davis &amp; Co. of Wellfleet are as follows: (1) "little
necks," small, 1&frac12;-2&frac14; inches; large, 2&frac14;-3 inches; (2) medium
"sharps," 3-3&frac34; inches; (3) large "sharps," 3&frac34; inches up; (4) small
"blunts;" (5) large "blunts."</p>

<p><i>Price.</i>&mdash;The prices received by the quahaugers are small, compared
with the retail prices. "Little necks" fetch from $2.50 to $4 per bushel,
sharps and small blunts from $1.10 to $2, and large blunts from 80
cents to $1.50, according to the season, fall and spring prices necessarily
being higher than in summer. The price depends wholly upon the
supply in the market, and varies greatly, although the "little necks"
are fairly constant, as the demand for these small quahaugs is very
great. To what excess the demand for "little necks" has reached can
best be illustrated by a comparison between the price of $3 paid to the
quahauger per bushel, and the actual price, $50, paid for the same by
the consumer in the hotel restaurants.</p>

<p><i>Bedding Quahaugs for Market.</i>&mdash;By town laws in Orleans, Eastham
and Wellfleet, each quahauger may, upon application, secure from the
selectmen a license, giving him not more than 75 feet square of tidal
flat upon which to bed his catch of quahaugs. While no positive protection
is guaranteed, public opinion recognizes the right of each man
to his leased area, and this alone affords sufficient protection for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
success of this communal effort, which is the first step by the people
toward quahaug farming.</p>

<p>The quahauger needs only to spread his catch on the surface, and
within two tides the quahaugs will have buried themselves in the sand.
Here they will remain, with no danger of moving away, as the quahaug
moves but little. The quahauger loses nothing by this replanting, as
not only do the quahaugs remain in a healthy condition, but even grow
in their new environment.</p>

<p>The result of this communal attempt at quahaug culture is beneficial.
While the market price for "little necks" is almost always steady, the
price of the larger quahaugs fluctuates considerably, and the market
often becomes "glutted." This would naturally result in a severe loss
to the quahauger if he were forced to keep shipping at a low price. As
it is, the fortunate quahauger who possesses such a grant merely replants
his daily catch until the market prices rise to their proper level.
An additional advantage is gained by the quahauger, who at the end of
the season has his grant well stocked, as higher prices are then offered.
As many as 1,000 barrels are often held this way at the end of the
season.</p>

<p><i>Food Value.</i>&mdash;See food value table in scallop report.</p>

<p><i>Uses.</i>&mdash;Besides its many uses as a food, raw, cooked and canned, the
quahaug is of little importance in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>(1) For bait the soft clam (<i>Mya arenaria</i>) is generally preferred,
and but few quahaugs are used for this purpose.</p>

<p>(2) The shell was once prized by the Indians for their wampum; now
it is occasionally used for ornamental purposes.</p>

<p>(3) Oystermen use it for cultch when they can get nothing better;
though more fragile shells are usually preferred, so that the masses of
oyster "set" can be easily broken apart.</p>

<p>(4) Shell roads are occasionally made from quahaug shells. Possibly
lime could be profitably obtained.</p>


<h3><i>History of Quahaug Industry in Massachusetts.</i></h3>

<p>South of Plymouth harbor quahaugs have always been plentiful along
the shores of Cape Cod, Buzzards Bay and the islands of Nantucket and
Martha's Vineyard. Frequent shell heaps show that the Indians were
accustomed to use this mollusk as a food, and even indulged in an occasional
clam bake. Colonial records show us that the early colonists
were not slow in learning to "tread out" this mollusk from the mud
flats. The shells of the quahaug were much prized by the Indians for
wampum beads, because of their purplish color.</p>

<p>Although reckoned inferior by many to the soft clam (<i>Mya arenaria</i>),
the quahaug was dug for home consumption for years in Massachusetts,
and but little attempt was made to put it on the market. The commercial
quahaug fishery started on Cape Cod, about the first of the
nineteenth century, growing in extent until about 1860. From 1860<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
to 1890 the production remained about constant. The production in
1879 for Massachusetts, as given by A. Howard Clark, totaled 11,050
bushels, valued at $5,525. It is only in the last fifteen to twenty years
that the actual development of the quahaug fishery has taken place.
The present production of Massachusetts is 144,044 bushels, valued
at $194,687. To the popular demand for the "little neck" can be
attributed the rapid development of the quahaug industry during the
last ten years. This development has furnished employment for hundreds
of men, and has given the quahaug an important value as a sea
food. What it will lead to is easily seen. The maximum production
was passed a few years ago, constant overfishing caused by an excessive
demand is destroying the natural supply, and there will in a few
years be practically no commercial fishery, unless measures are taken
to increase the natural supply. Quahaug farming offers the best solution
at the present time, and gives promise of permanent success.</p>

<p>The following statistics, taken from the United States Fish Commission
reports, show the rapidity of the development of the quahaug
fishery:&mdash;</p>

<p>Not only has there been an increase in production, but also an increase
in price, as can be seen from the above table, which shows that
the price has more than doubled between 1888 and 1902. This increase
in price has alone supported a declining fishery in many towns, making
it still profitable for quahaugers to keep in the business, in spite of a
much smaller catch. The advance in price is due both to the natural
rise in the value of food products during the past twenty-five years and
also to the popular demand for the "little neck," or small quahaug.</p>

<p><i>State Laws.</i>&mdash;There are no State laws governing the quahaug fishery,
except the regulations of the State Board of Health in regard to sewage
pollution in Acushnet River and Boston Harbor.</p>

<p><i>Town Laws.</i>&mdash;Regulation of the quahaug fishery was given to each
town by the State under the general shellfish act of 1880; the industry
is therefore entirely governed under the by-laws of the town.</p>

<p>An interesting comparison can be made between the quahaug regulations
of the different towns. Good, useless and harmful laws exist
side by side. One town will pass excellent regulations, and enforce
them; another town will make the same, but never trouble to see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
they are observed. Edgartown enforces the 1&frac12;-inch quahaug law;
Orleans, Eastham and Wellfleet have the same law, but fail to enforce
it. Many towns allow the small seed quahaugs to be caught and
shipped out of the State, thus losing $4 to every $1 gained. These
towns refuse to make any regulation, such as a simple size limit,
which would remedy this matter, and have no thought for the future of
their quahaug industry. All that can be said is that the quahaug laws
are the best of the town shellfish regulations, and that is but faint
praise.</p>


<h3><i>Statistics of the Quahaug Fishery.</i></h3>

<p>In the following table the towns are arranged in alphabetical order,
and the list includes only those towns which now possess a commercial
quahaug fishery. In giving the number of men, both transient and
regular quahaugers are included. In estimating the capital invested,
the boats, implements, shanties and gear of the quahauger are alone
considered, and personal apparel, such as oilskins, boots, etc., are not
taken into account. The value of the production for each town is based
upon what the quahaugers receive for their quahaugs, and not the price
they bring in the market. The area of quahaug territory given for
each town includes all ground where quahaugs are found, both thick
beds and scattering quahaugs.</p>

<h3><i>Barnstable.</i></h3>

<p>Barnstable, with its extensive bays both on the north or bay side
and on the south or Vineyard Sound side, offers great possibilities for
quahaug production. Although the quahaug ranks, in productive value,
the third shellfish industry of Barnstable, the natural resources permit
an expansion under cultural methods which would place the quahaug
ahead of the oyster, which at the present time is the leading shellfish
industry of the town.</p>

<p>In Barnstable harbor, on the north coast of the town, a few quahaugs
are found scattered in isolated patches. (See Map No. 9.) These are
relatively of small importance commercially, and no regular fishery is
carried on. In the future the vast barren flats of this harbor may be
made productive of quahaugs as well as clams, although at present the
total area of quahaug grounds is hardly 5 acres.</p>

<p>The greater part of the quahaug industry of Barnstable is conducted
on the south shore of the township, which is especially adapted, with
its coves and inlets, for the successful growth of this shellfish. The
principal fishery is in Cotuit harbor and West Bay, and is chiefly shared
by the villages of Osterville, Marston's Mills and Cotuit, which lie on
the east, north and west sides, respectively, of the bay.</p>

<p>While the greater part of Cotuit harbor is taken up by oyster grants,
there are certain parts, though limited in area, which are set aside for
quahauging. The principal area for quahauging is the flat which runs
along Oyster Island. This was originally an oyster grant taken out
by Wendell Nickerson, and thrown open to quahaugers to protect the
quahaug interests from the oyster planters. This territory, which comprises
70 acres, is mostly hard sand. Directly west in the center of
the harbor lies a strip of 80 acres of mud and eel grass, where both
quahaugs and scallops abound. The depth of water on quahauging
grounds varies from 1 to 14 feet.</p>

<p>Scattering quahaugs are found also in Osterville harbor, West Bay,
Popponesset River and East Bay. This bottom is practically all sand,
and comprises a total of 1,650 acres. This cannot all be considered
good quahaug ground, although quahaugs can occasionally be found.</p>

<p>At Hyannis the quahaug grounds are confined to Lewis Bay, where
they cover an area of 800 acres. The quahaugs lie in scattered patches
over this area, but in no place is there especially good quahauging.
The bottom is hard, usually sandy, with patches of eel grass, while
the average depth of water is hardly more than 6 feet.</p>

<p>In Osterville Bay about 20 men, in Lewis Bay about 5, using the
same number of dories, make a business of quahauging in the summer
months. Three styles of implements are used: (1) oyster tongs, varying
from 8 to 16 feet, according to the depth of water; (2) large
basket rakes, with 30-foot handles; (3) ordinary garden rakes, with
wire basket, for shallow-water digging.</p>

<p>At Cotuit the quahaugs run one-third "little necks," one-third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
mediums and one-third large. Here several men, using long-handled
rakes, make from $3 to $5 per day in favorable weather. The markets
are principally New York and Boston, where the quahaugs are shipped,
mostly in sacks, which is a cheaper and better way than shipment in
barrels. Here the quahaug season lasts from April 1 to November 1,
most of the work being done in the summer, when the oyster business
is at a standstill.</p>

<p>There are no town laws governing the quahaug fishery, other than
forbidding a non-resident of the town the right of quahauging; and
no licenses are required.</p>

<p>No records of the history of the quahaug industry at Barnstable
can be found. A. Howard Clark in 1879 makes the following brief
statement, which is the only record obtainable:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Both soft clams and quahaugs are found in the harbor [Osterville harbor],
but no considerable fishing for them is carried on.</p></div>

<h3><i>Bourne.</i></h3>

<p>The town of Bourne was formerly included in the town of Sandwich,
and many old laws relating to shellfish, such as oyster regulation
in Barlow River, were enacted by the town of Sandwich. Situated at
the head of Buzzards Bay, and separated from the adjacent town of
Wareham by Cohasset Narrows, Bourne has many advantages for
a profitable quahaug industry. It possesses nearly twice as much quahaug
territory as Wareham, but, as most of this lies unproductive,
has a smaller annual output. The territory includes over 2,500 acres of
ground, most of which consists of flats of mud, sand and eel grass,
covered with shallow water. It is very sparsely set with quahaugs.
Outside the oyster grants practically the entire stretch of coast from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Buttermilk Bay to Wings Neck is quahauging ground, as can be seen
on Map No. 17. Other quahaug grounds lie between Basset's Island,
Scraggy Neck and Handy's Point. It is our opinion that this large
territory, which to-day yields on the average less than $3.50 per acre,
in the future, under cultivation, can be made to yield an average of
$100 per acre, thereby bringing into the town of Bourne a yearly
income of at least $250,000, and furnishing labor for hundreds of men.</p>

<p>About 46 men are engaged in the quahaug fishery of Bourne, using
the same number of skiffs and dories, which represent approximately
an investment of $875. The fishery lasts usually seven months during
the summer, April 1 to November 1, while the winter digging is of
small account. Practically all the digging is done in comparatively
shallow water, with short-handled rakes or tongs. Rather more than
a third of the quahaugs appear to be "little necks," while the mediums
constitute one-tenth of the total catch. "Blunts" are of little consequence.</p>

<p>The selectmen issue permits for the taking of quahaugs and clams.
In 1906, 46 permits were issued, entitling the holder to 10 bushels
of clams and 10 bushels of quahaugs per week.</p>

<p>There is little to be said concerning the history of the Bourne quahaug
industry, as no early records exist. Its development has been similar
to that of the industries of the other Buzzards Bay towns. During
the last few years the Bourne fishery, unlike most of the towns on
Buzzards Bay, has shown signs of increasing. This is not due, however,
to any increase in the natural supply, but to the decline of the
oyster industry, which gives more opportunity to the quahaugers. The
same antagonistic feeling that is prevalent in Wareham exists here
between the oystermen and quahaugers.</p>

<h3><i>Chatham.</i></h3>

<p>Chatham is favorably situated in regard to the quahaug fishery, as
this shellfish is found in the waters on the north and south sides of
the town. The grounds are extensive, covering about 2,000 acres,
the greater part of which consists of the vast area south of the town
known as the "Common Flats."</p>

<p>The quahauging grounds are in four localities: (1) Pleasant Bay;
(2) Mill Pond; (3) Stage Harbor; (4) Common Flats.</p>

<p>(1) Part of the waters of Pleasant Bay belong to the town of
Chatham. In an arm of this bay, known as Crows Pond, the best
Pleasant Bay fishery is carried on in water varying from 6 to 16 feet
in depth.</p>

<p>(2) An excellent "little neck" fishery is carried on in the upper
part of the Mill Pond, in comparatively shallow water, comprising
an area of 3 acres. On these bars in 1905 there was a very heavy set of
small quahaugs, which were rapidly taken up before they had a chance
to attain to a fair size.</p>

<p>(3) Quahaugs are raked on the west side of Stage Harbor in 5
to 15 feet of water, in an area of 4 acres of muddy bottom.</p>

<p>(4) The Common Flats comprise 1,700 acres, and are covered at
low tide by a depth of only 1 to 2 feet of water. Quahaugs are found
throughout this territory in scattering quantities, but practically all
is good quahaug ground except the shifting outer part of the flat.
The soil varies from a pure sand to a sandy mud, and in parts is
thickly covered with eel grass, which makes raking hard. This area
offers one of the best opportunities for successful quahaug planting in
the State. The area is large, seed can be obtained easily and quahaugs
grow well in this locality. If it were not for the lack of protection,
Chatham could establish one of the best quahaug industries in the State
by leasing out the Common Flats for planting purposes.</p>

<p>Quahaugs are taken at Chatham only with rakes. In the deep water
in Crows Pond and in Stage Harbor basket rakes are used; but in the
shallow water on the Common Flats and in the Mill Pond the usual
implement is an ordinary garden rake, with wire netting basket. Handles
from 20 to 25 feet in length are used with the basket rakes.</p>

<p>The quahaug industry has existed in Chatham for the past twelve
years.</p>

<h3><i>Dartmouth.</i></h3>

<p>The quahaug industry of Dartmouth is of little consequence. In
1907, 320 permits were granted, mostly to New Bedford fishermen for
"bait."</p>


<h3><i>Dennis.</i></h3>

<p>The quahauging grounds of Dennis are practically all in Bass River,
where Dennis has equal fishery rights with Yarmouth. The area of
these grounds is 200 acres, with a maximum depth of 6 feet of water
over the beds. The history of the industry is the same as that of
Yarmouth, as the two industries are closely associated, and a similar
decline has resulted. The laws for both towns are the same.</p>

<h3><i>Eastham.</i></h3>

<p>Eastham is similar to Orleans in situation, possessing a good coast
line on both the east and west, which affords excellent opportunities
for the quahaug fishery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>On the west or bay side are extensive beds of quahaugs, for the
most part blunts, extending into deep water for nearly 3 miles. This
quahauging territory comprises about 4,000 acres, which is open to the
quahaugers of both Wellfleet and Orleans. While scattering quahaugs
are found over approximately all this territory, the fishery is conducted
in only certain definite places.</p>

<p>In Nauset harbor on the east side during the season of 1906 numerous
beds of "little necks," about the 1&frac12;-inch size, were discovered. It is
thought that these came from the spawn of certain quahaugs which the
life savers were accustomed to bed in the harbor for their own use.
These quahaugs were torn up and scattered by the ice during a severe
winter, and in this way the nucleus of a new fishery was formed. Two
men who discovered the best of these beds cleared $60 in one week.</p>

<p>On the west coast of the town 25 men commonly dig with long-handled
rakes. These fishermen work at quahauging about 100 days in
the year, and average from 5 to 6 bushels per day. Power boats are
used for the most part, although the boats are not so large or expensive
as those of the Orleans fishermen, for the Eastham quahauger digs in
the more sheltered waters of Wellfleet Bay.</p>

<p>The production for 1906 was 10,000 bushels, but this does not give
the true yield of the Eastham flats, as the Wellfleet and Orleans fishermen
rake to a great extent in Eastham waters, and so many more
bushels are actually taken within the town limits.</p>

<p>The town laws of Eastham are the same as those of Wellfleet. (See
Wellfleet.) The history of the Eastham quahaug industry is so closely
connected with that of Orleans and Wellfleet that no additional features
require mention.</p>

<h3><i>Edgartown.</i></h3>

<p>The finest "little neck" fishery in Massachusetts is found in Katama
Bay, in the town of Edgartown. Two-fifths of the entire catch are
"little necks." The most productive grounds are situated in the lower
part of Katama Bay, while quahaugs are also found in Edgartown
harbor and in Cape Poge Pond, the total area of these localities comprising
1,800 acres.</p>

<p>The fishing is mostly done from power dories or sail boats with
basket rakes. Poles from 20 to 25 feet long are used, as the water over
the beds is less than 20 feet deep. Some quahaugs are taken in the
shallow water with small claw rakes. The catch is shipped to the New
York and Boston markets.</p>

<p>The quahaug industry of Edgartown is the best-regulated shellfish
industry in Massachusetts. If excellent care had not been taken of the
"little neck" fishery of Katama Bay by enforcing a size limit of 1&frac12;
inches, through the employment of a special shellfish warden, the quahaug
fishery of Edgartown would have been ruined long ago by the
exportation of small "seed" quahaugs. To-day the number of small
quahaugs which are returned to the water greatly exceeds the amount
of marketable quahaugs taken. This is the only case in Massachusetts
where the quahaug fishery, by careful regulations of the town, has
maintained an undiminished supply. If other towns had taken similar
care of their quahaug fisheries in the past, the general decline of the
industry in this State would never have become so serious.</p>

<p>The following is a copy of the shellfish permit, which every Edgartown
quahauger is required to take out, at the cost of $2, before he
can rake quahaugs for market. Any man over sixty years old obtains
his permit free. This permit should serve as a model for other towns.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Shellfish Permit.</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Town of Edgartown, Selectmen's Office,</span> 190_.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In consideration of having received from ____ of Edgartown the
sum of $2, permission is hereby granted to him to take from any of the
waters of this town daily, between sunrise and sunset, twenty-five bushels of
scallops or clams, including shells, and four bushels, including shells, of
quahaugs; of these four bushels, not more than two bushels are to be of the
size known as "little necks."</p>

<p>The acceptance of this permit constitutes an agreement by the holder
thereof that he will, and that any other person who for the time being has
or shall have in his custody or possession any building, boat, barrel, box, tub,
crate or other vessel or receptacle containing or suitable for or capable of
containing shellfish, and belonging to or under the control of the holder
of this permit, shall, at any time or place when requested so to do by either
of said selectmen or by their authorized agent, or by any constable or fish
warden of said town, or by any other officer authorized to enforce the laws
relating to shellfish or shellfisheries in said town, open any such building,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>

than ten nor more than one hundred dollars.</p>

<p>This permit will expire April 1, 190&nbsp;, unless sooner revoked.</p></div>

<p class="right"><i>Selectmen of Edgartown.</i></p>

<p>Ernest Ingersoll in 1879 makes the following statement concerning
the quahaug fishery of Martha's Vineyard:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Martha's Vineyard used to be bordered by good quahaug ground, but I am
not aware that many are caught there now. In an old book I find the following
allusion to it: "The poquau (<i>Venus mercenaria</i>) is found in Old
Town Harbor, at Cape Poge, and in Menemsha Pond: great quantities are
exported."</p></div>

<p>A. Howard Clark in 1879 says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Soft clams and quahaugs are abundant in the harbor, and are used by the
fishermen for bait.... Three hundred bushels of quahaugs and sea clams,
valued at $150, were taken during the year 1879.</p></div>

<p>If such were the conditions in 1879, the industry has had a great
development. To-day Edgartown is one of the best quahaug towns
of the State, and produces the finest "little necks." Comparing the
production figures of 1879 and 1907, a great increase is noted:&mdash;</p>

<h3><i>Fairhaven.</i></h3>

<p>At Fairhaven the quahaug industry is of considerable importance,
and the output from this town alone is nearly half the entire production
of Buzzards Bay.</p>

<p>Some 3,000 acres are more or less bedded with quahaugs. Of this,
probably not more than one-tenth is very productive. The best
quahauging is in Acushnet River, where digging for market has been
forbidden because of sewage pollution (see New Bedford), and in
Priests Cove as far as Sconticut Neck. In these grounds "little necks"
are numerous. The grounds around West Island and Long Island, once
very productive, are now largely dug out. Little Bay and the east
coast of Sconticut Neck are fairly productive, while the west coast
yields only a small amount. Most of the quahaugs now dug come
from the deep water west-southwest of Sconticut Neck. Here, with
rakes having handles from 40 to 60 feet long, the quahaugers dig
in water 7 fathoms or more in depth. The quahaugs, mostly large
sharps, are in bluish mud or sticky bottom, and are all large. A number
of blunts are found with these large sharps. In the Acushnet River,
owing to the enforced closed season, there are a large number of "little
necks."</p>

<p>About 115 men are employed now in quahauging. Before the Acushnet
River was closed by law, over twice that number are reported to
have been engaged in the business. Six power boats and five cat boats,
besides a considerable number of skiffs and dories, are used in the
fishery.</p>

<p>No permits are required for ordinary quahauging except in the pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>scribed
territory of Acushnet River, where permits to catch a certain
amount for bait are given as in New Bedford.</p>

<p>The production for 1879, as given by A. Howard Clark in "The
Fisheries of Massachusetts," was 3,000 bushels, which is just one-fifth
of the present production. The supply of quahaugs has decreased the
last few years, though new territory is constantly being opened up,
as the quahaugers go out further into the deeper water. The increased
price, however, probably more than counterbalances the decline in
production.</p>

<h3><i>Falmouth.</i></h3>

<p>There is practically no quahaug industry in Falmouth. Hardly 100
bushels are dug annually, and those only for home consumption. A
few quahaugs are perhaps shipped by the oystermen.</p>

<p>This town, with its numerous inlets, bays and brackish water ponds,
offers perhaps as fine an opportunity for shellfish culture, especially
for quahaugs, as exists in Massachusetts. There is no reason why
the water of Waquoit Bay and the other brackish ponds should not
produce a great supply of quahaugs, if properly worked.</p>

<p>Quahaugs are found mostly in scattering quantities over a large area
in Waquoit Bay and in small quantities on the north and west side
of Great Pond, comprising a total of nearly 400 acres. Not all this
ground, which is the greater part mud, is capable of producing quahaugs,
but many parts could produce good harvests. On the bay
side of the town small patches of good quahaugs are found at North
Falmouth, Squeteague Pond, West Falmouth harbor on the southeast
side, and a few are found in Hadley harbor, Naushon. These, together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
with the small patches in Great Pond, comprise about 1 acre of good
quahaug ground, and are mostly dug by summer people.</p>

<p>In the past twenty-five years there has been a great decline in the
quahaug industry, especially in Waquoit Bay, which to-day barely produces
50 bushels. A. Howard Clark states, in 1879:<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Quahaugs are plenty in Waquoit Bay, and are gathered and eaten by the
villagers, but none are shipped. It is estimated that about 500 bushels of
quahaugs are annually consumed by the people of Falmouth town.</p></div>

<h3><i>Harwich.</i></h3>

<p>The quahaug fishery of the town of Harwich is carried on in that
part of Pleasant Bay which lies within the town limits. In the
southern waters of the town, on the Sound side, scattering quahaugs
are found in certain localities, but are not of any commercial importance.
The most important of those localities are off Dean's Creek
and in Herring River, where quahaugs are dug for home consumption.</p>

<p>Harwich shares with Chatham and Orleans the quahaug fishery of
Pleasant Bay, but has a more limited territory, as only a small portion
of Pleasant Bay lies within the town limits. Practically all this territory,
comprising 100 acres, is quahauging ground, though the commercial
quahauging is prosecuted over an area of 10 acres only. Scattering
quahaugs are found over an area of 100 acres.</p>

<p>As the waters of Pleasant Bay are sheltered, the fishing is all done
from dories, with basket rakes having 20 to 25 foot poles. The depth
of water over the quahaug beds is from 6 to 16 feet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<p>In regard to the quahaug fishery in Pleasant Bay, Mr. Warren J.
Nickerson of East Harwich, who has been acquainted with the industry
for many years, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Pleasant Bay is and has been a very valuable quahaug ground. Some
fifty years ago there were shipped in vessels to New Haven and other places
13,000 bushels in one year from its waters. Since then there has been more
or less taken from these waters by fishermen from the towns of Orleans,
Chatham and Harwich. During the last few years there have been 25 regular
fishermen and perhaps 12 transient. Probably 8,000 bushels a year for
the last five years would be a fair estimate of the catch. Thirty per cent
of these were "little necks."</p></div>

<h3><i>Marion.</i></h3>

<p>The town of Marion, situated on the western side of Buzzards Bay,
possesses a spacious harbor, the waters of which furnish excellent quahaug
grounds.</p>

<p>This territory, comprising a total of 400 acres, is chiefly confined to
Marion harbor, running in a narrow strip parallel to the shore from
Aucoot Cove all along the coast to Planting Island. Almost all the
head of the harbor and all of Blankinship's and Planting Island Cove
is quahaug area. Small grounds are also found at Wing's Cove and
in the Weweantit River.</p>

<p>The town law requires each year the possession of a permit costing
$1 before a person is entitled to dig quahaugs for sale. Nineteen of
these licenses were issued in 1906, but not more than 2 or 3 of these
went to men who depend upon quahauging for a living. The remaining
16 engage in the fishery to a greater or lesser extent in the
summer season.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>The annual production for 1906 was 800 bushels, valued at $1,500,
as about half were "little necks." Mediums are not numerous, and are
bought by the quahaug dealers at $1.25 per bushel and sold by them
at so much per hundred.</p>

<p>In Marion the quahaug industry once flourished to a marked degree,
but at present is very much on the decline. The coves, which once were
bedded with "little necks" and quahaugs, are now nearly exhausted.
No reasons exist for this condition of affairs, so far as known, except
overdigging. Gradually for many years the supply has perceptibly
declined, until now it is at a very low ebb. Where a thousand barrels
were formerly produced, it is doubtful if a thousand bushels are now
dug during the entire season, and the overworked beds are becoming
each year more depleted. A. Howard Clark, in his report on the
fisheries of Marion, estimates the quahaug production in 1880 as 2,000
bushels. The yield for 1906 is only 800 bushels, which shows an alarming
decline in production. If once the waters of Marion could produce
a large amount of quahaugs, there is no reason why they cannot again
be made to produce the same, or more.</p>

<h3><i>Mashpee.</i></h3>

<p>The quahaug industry at Mashpee is at a low ebb. Natural facilities
are favorable, but a lack of initiative on the part of the inhabitants
causes a small production. The best grounds are found in Popponessett
Bay and River, where a territory of 200 acres includes several
oyster grants which are worked but little. On the east side of Waquoit
Bay scattering quahaugs are found in Mashpee waters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>There are 3 regular and 4 intermittent quahaugers, with an invested
capital of $70, who are obliged by the town laws to have a permit costing
$1. The quahaug industry of the town has remained about the
same for the last twenty-five years, and now a good quahauger can
scarcely average 1&frac12; to 2 bushels per day.</p>

<h3><i>Mattapoisett.</i></h3>

<p>The town of Mattapoisett, situated to the west of Marion, receives
but little income from her shellfisheries, as the waters are for the most
part too open and exposed for shellfish culture. The quahaug fishery
is the most important shellfish industry of the town, but even this,
when compared with the quahaug fishery of other towns, is rather unimportant,
as most of the suitable territory is nonproductive.</p>

<p>Quahaugs are very unevenly distributed over 800 acres. The best
quahaugs are found in Aucoot Cove and at Brants. In the main harbor
quahaugs are found, though scattering, as indicated on the map.</p>

<p>No licenses or permits are required of the 28 men and boys who add
to their income from time to time by quahauging. Most of these depend
on other sources of employment for their main support. The
industry as a whole is gradually declining, as overfishing has made it
impossible for the natural supply to perpetuate itself.</p>

<h3><i>Nantucket.</i></h3>

<p>The quahaug industry of Nantucket ranks second to the main shellfish
industry, the scallop fishery, and brings annually about $8,000 to
the island. Nantucket is especially adapted for quahaugs, as Nantucket
harbor, Maddequet harbor and the Island of Tuckernuck possess
extensive territory. In spite of these natural advantages, which are
as fine as any in the State, Nantucket produces only 6,000 bushels
annually, whereas her resources, under proper cultural methods, warrant
an annual production exceeding even that of Wellfleet, which is
at present shipping 33,000 bushels.</p>

<p>The quahauging territory of Nantucket is divided into three sections:
(1) Nantucket harbor; (2) Maddequet harbor; and (3) Tuckernuck.</p>

<p>In Nantucket harbor quahaugs are found over an area of 2,290 acres,
both scattering and in thick patches. The principal areas are situated
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Near the town between Monomoy Heights and the wharves is
a territory of 240 acres. In the deep water directly out from the
wharves there has been good quahauging although the bed was discovered
only a few years ago.</p>

<p>(2) On the east side of the harbor, between Abram's Point and Pocomo
Head, including Polpis harbor, are extensive grounds, comprising
about 900 acres, of scattering quahaugs.</p>

<p>(3) On the opposite side of the harbor lies a strip of quahaug territory
of 250 acres, which extends between Third Point and Bass Point.</p>

<p>(4) At the head of the harbor on both sides quahaugs are found over
an area of 900 acres.</p>

<p>Maddequet harbor on the western end of the island has approximately
300 acres suitable for quahaugs, running from Broad Creek to
Eel Point.</p>

<p>On the eastern end of Tuckernuck Island is a bed of quahaugs covering
about 200 acres; while on the west side, between Muskeget and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Tuckernuck, is a large area of 2,500 acres, which is more or less productive.
The Tuckernuck fishery is largely "little necks," and it is from
here that the shipment of small "seed" quahaugs has been made.</p>

<p>In the spring and fall men who have been boatmen during the summer
work at quahauging. While 48 men work irregularly, about 18
men are engaged in the fishery during the entire summer, though probably
never more than 30 are raking at any one time.</p>

<p>The production in 1906, from April I to November I, was 2,159
barrels, or 6,477 bushels; value, $7,557.</p>

<p>The month of June shows the largest production, as the summer
people do not arrive in any numbers until July. The men who do
the summer boating are engaged in the quahaug fishery during this
month, naturally increasing the production.</p>

<p>The principal method is raking from a boat or dory with a long-handled
basket rake, very similar in form to the rake used on Cape
Cod. The second method, applicable only in shallow water, employs
the use of a claw rake with a much shorter handle. The quahauger uses
this rake in the shallow water, where he can wade at low tide. The
largest claw rakes are often wider than the basket rakes, and are much
cheaper.</p>

<p>At Nantucket about 5 per cent. of the entire catch is "little necks,"
which are found mostly at Tuckernuck. The quahauger usually makes
three culls of his catch: (1) "little necks"; (2) medium; (3) large.
A few blunts are obtained. The quahaugs are shipped chiefly to New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
York and Boston markets, either directly by the quahaugers or through
Nantucket firms.</p>

<p>The boats used in the industry, numbering 24 sail, 6 power and 10
single dories, and approximating $6,150 in value, are in a way transitory
capital, and are used in the winter for scalloping and other fishing.
Nevertheless, it is necessary to class them as capital used in the quahaug
fishery.</p>

<p>No special town laws are made for the regulation of the Nantucket
quahaug fishery, although at any time by vote of the town suitable
regulations and by-laws can be made.</p>

<p>Quahaugs have probably always been abundant at Nantucket, as over
fifty years ago they were reported as plentiful. It is only of late years
that the fishery has assumed any great importance, when the increasing
prices, especially for the "little necks," made it profitable for men to
enter the business. As it is, many men now quahaug only when they
have nothing else to do.</p>

<p>From the statistics of the United States Fish Commission for 1879
we find that the annual catch for that year amounted to 150 bushels,
valued at $75. As a striking contrast to this, the present production
of 6,294 bushels, valued at $8,487, shows the great development of the
fishery, which has been caused by more men entering the business, the
opening up of new beds, such as the "little neck" beds of Tuckernuck,
and the improved methods of raking in the deep water.</p>

<p>It is rather difficult to state definitely, from lack of past statistical
figures, whether Nantucket industry is declining or improving. Between
1879 and 1906 no records are obtainable. The production figures for
1906 show 6,477 bushels, as compared with 6,144 bushels in 1907.
Whether there was merely a sudden temporary increase in the supply
by the opening up of new beds in 1906, or whether there is a steady
decline, can only be determined by the production of future years.
Many indications point to the latter, in spite of the assurance of the
quahaugers that 1907 was a good season, because of high market prices.</p>

<p>The last few years have witnessed a change in the quahaug fishery,&mdash;a
realization that there is more money in planting and raising quahaugs
than in oyster culture. The out-of-State oystermen, especially
in New York, have been the first to realize this, and have been
buying, at the rate of $4 to $5 per bushel, all the small quahaugs they
can procure, merely replanting, to reap the following year a yield of
3 to 6 bushels for every bushel planted.</p>

<p>Under the stimulus of the high prices offered, many bushels of small
quahaugs have been shipped from the town, which thus lost what the
planters gained. There is much feeling against such a practice, but
so far nothing has been done by the town to stop this shipping of
"seed" quahaugs. As the town has full control of its shellfisheries,
it has only to pass a simple law allowing no quahaugs under 2 inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
to be taken, and see that it is properly enforced. Such a matter should
be attended to at once, as not only is the actual value of the catch
diminished, but the industry is seriously impaired by the capture of
these small quahaugs before they can spawn.</p>

<p>The only other way to remedy this difficulty is to grant licenses allowing
the replanting of these small quahaugs on the barren parts of the
harbor until they have obtained a proper size. The results obtained
from the experiments of the commission in Polpis harbor show that quahaugs
will grow rapidly when thus replanted in suitable places, and
that a gain of &frac12; to &frac34; of an inch, or 3 to 6 bushels for every bushel
bedded, can be obtained during the six summer months (May to
November).</p>

<h3><i>New Bedford.</i></h3>

<p>The quahaug industry of New Bedford was practically annihilated
by the law of 1905, which closed the Acushnet River and Clark's Cove
to both clammer and quahauger. Good beds of quahaugs, particularly
"little necks," exist in both these waters, but can be taken only for
bait. As several sewers run into the Acushnet River, and the public
health was endangered by the consumption as food of the quahaugs
taken from the river and the waters near its mouth, nearly 400 acres of
quahaug territory were closed by the State Board of Health. What
little available territory there is outside the prescribed area, off Clark's
Point, is free to all.</p>

<p>A license is required to dig quahaugs for bait in this territory, and
such is issued free of charge. The maximum amount permitted to be
dug is 2 bushels per week of clams or quahaugs, or of both. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
320 permits have been issued since the law was passed, in 1905. Eleven
of these have been since revoked for unlawful conduct on the part of
the possessors. For the first offence the license is merely revoked, for
the second a fine of $10, and for the third $100 is imposed.</p>


<h3><i>Orleans.</i></h3>

<p>Although Orleans is well represented by all four main types of shellfish,
the quahaug fishery is the leading industry of the town. A favorable
coast line, fronting on the west the waters of Cape Cod Bay and
bounded on the east by Pleasant Bay, provides excellent facilities for
the quahaug fishery.</p>

<p>The main quahauging territory is in Cape Cod Bay. While the west
coast of Orleans is only about a mile long, the privileges which allow
the citizens of Orleans free fishing in Eastham waters, according to
the act of incorporation in 1792, "whereby the benefits of the shellfishery
were to be mutually shared," opens up an extensive tract of
quahaug territory, from 2 to 3 miles in width, extending north as far
as Billingsgate Island and the Wellfleet line. The actual Orleans quahaug
territory consists only of 1,000 acres, which furnish but poor
quahauging, while the water is several fathoms deep.</p>

<p>On the east side an entirely different condition prevails. Here in
the waters of Pleasant Bay is a bed of quahaugs which, though
worked for a long time, is still in excellent condition. The proportion
of "little necks" is larger than on the west side, running about one-half
the entire catch; neither is the water as deep here, rarely having
a greater depth than 12 feet, and by no means as rough as the more
exposed waters of Cape Cod Bay. The quahauging grounds here comprise
500 acres.</p>

<p>Although there are 1,500 acres of quahaug territory in the town of
Orleans, only a small part of this is commercially productive, and the
larger part of the fishery is carried on in Eastham waters.</p>

<p>The possession of two entirely different quahaug grounds, one on the
east, the other on the west coast, makes practically two different industries,
each of which will have to be considered separately.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Cape Cod Bay Industry.</i>&mdash;In Cape Cod Bay 50 men rake quahaugs
whenever the weather will permit. Owing to the great depth of
water, the work is difficult, requiring rakes with handles often 60 feet
long. Two men generally go in one boat, the usual type being an
elongated dory, some 30 to 32 feet over all, carrying from 4 to 12 horse-power
gasolene engines. These boats are built to stand rough weather,
and cost from $700 to $1,000 apiece. Thirty boats are employed in this
business in the bay.</p>

<p>The quahauger averages perhaps 100 working days in a year, as in
a strong wind and choppy sea it is impossible to rake in the deep water.
A good fisherman expects to rake from 2 to 3 barrels of quahaugs a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
day. Five to ten years ago as many as 15 barrels were dug in a day by
one man, but this is impossible now. Even as it is, the profits are large.
The best quahauger in Orleans cleared in 1906 over $1,600, while several
others made nearly $1,400. As at Wellfleet, the Orleans quahaugers
receive licenses to replant their quahaugs along the shore, and it is customary
to thus keep them until the New York or Boston markets offer
suitable prices. Nearly two-thirds of these deep-water quahaugs are
blunts, and perhaps one-tenth of the catch is "little necks."</p>

<p>(2) <i>Pleasant Bay Industry.</i>&mdash;About 25 men dig here from ordinary
dories, using short rakes and tongs. The average wages are $2 to
$3 per day, which is considerably less than the high wages of the Cape
Cod Bay fishery; but many more days can be utilized during the year,
while the work is much easier and the necessary outlay of capital is
slight. Here the quahaugs run about one-half "little necks," and the
proportion of blunts is small.</p>

<p>Little evidence of decline can be seen in Pleasant Bay, where the
bed of quahaugs, although raked for a long time, still shows few signs
of decrease. On the Cape Cod Bay side the reverse is true, and the
supply is gradually diminishing.</p>

<p>The same town laws for regulation of the quahaug fishery apply
for Wellfleet, Eastham and Orleans. (See Wellfleet.)</p>

<p>The main historical features of the quahaug industry at Orleans have
been similar to Wellfleet, the industry lying practically dormant until
1894, when it rapidly reached its present production. Unfortunately,
but little data can be obtained for comparison of the industry of 1879
with 1907. Ernest Ingersoll reports, in 1879:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At Orleans, some few men who go mackereling in summer stay at home
and dig clams in winter, getting perhaps 50 barrels of quahaugs among
others, which are peddled in the town.</p></div>

<h3><i>Provincetown.</i></h3>

<p>No commercial quahaug fishery is carried on at Provincetown. A
few quahaugs, chiefly "little necks," are found in the tide pools among
the thatch on the northwestern side of the harbor.</p>


<h3><i>Swansea.</i></h3>

<p>A quahaug fishery existed in Swansea until three years ago. Since
that time there has been no commercial fishery, though a few quahaugs
are still dug for home consumption.</p>


<h3><i>Truro.</i></h3>

<p>Occasionally a few scattering quahaugs are found on the bars, which
extend out one-quarter of a mile from shore on the bay side. No
quahaug fishery is carried on.</p>


<h3><i>Wareham.</i></h3>

<p>The town of Wareham, situated on the northeast side of Buzzards
Bay and separated from the adjoining town of Bourne by Cohasset
Narrows, has a coast line indented with numerous small inlets, bays
and rivers, which afford excellent opportunities for the growth of the
quahaug. The villages of Onset, Wareham and part of Buzzards Bay
enjoy the privileges of this fishery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>Quahaugs are found over practically the entire territory, and comprise
a total area of about 1,300 acres. Although much of this area
is barren, the commercial fishery is maintained by small isolated beds
which occur here and there.</p>

<p>The two principal centers of the industry are in the Wareham River
and in Onset Bay. At Onset the whole bay, except the oyster grants,
as included between the southeast end of Mashnee Island and Peters
Neck, is used for quahauging. A few quahaugs are found in Broad
Cove, and fair digging is obtained in Buttermilk Bay and Cohasset
Narrows. The Wareham River, outside the oyster grants, and a narrow
shore strip from Weweantit River to Tempe's Knob, comprise the
rest of the territory. In Onset Channel a fine bed exists in deep water,
2 to 4 fathoms, but the ground is so hard that not much digging is
done.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the map that practically 75 per cent. of the
quahaug territory is taken up by oyster grants, especially in the Wareham
River and Onset Bay. Town sentiment is in a chaotic state over
the oyster and quahaug deadlock, and much friction naturally exists
between the opposing factions, the quahaugers and oystermen. The
struggle between these two parties was at its height several years ago,
and the enmity still continues, though not so openly, owing to the decline
of the quahaug industry. Rightly managed, affairs ought to be so
arranged that prosperity might be brought to both factions; but town
customs and town laws, poorly enforced at the best, are hardly able
to cope with this evil, which has resulted in much expense legally and
financially to both parties, and both industries are badly crippled in
consequence,&mdash;the oyster industry by lack of protection and the quahaug
industry by loss of grounds. It is hoped that in the future suitable
arrangements can be made for both industries, and that the quahaug
industry, which is at present declining, can be put on an equal footing
with the oyster industry, by granting licenses to plant and grow quahaugs.</p>

<p>Most of the digging is done with garden rakes, potato diggers or
by hand. Some tongs are used, but few if any long-handled basket
rakes, since the digging is chiefly confined to the shallow water, not
more than 10 feet deep, except in Onset Channel, where it ranges from
12 to 24 feet.</p>

<p>No information or statistical records of the quahaug fishery of Wareham
can be obtained, and it is therefore impossible to draw any comparison
between the present industry and the industry of twenty-five
years ago.</p>

<p>The decline of the quahaug fishery in Wareham is an established
fact. The production of 6,000 bushels for 1906 is far less than the
production of five years ago. Since 1901 the output has steadily declined,
and where the quahauger once was able to rake 5 bushels at a
tide, to-day he can rake scarcely 1 bushel in the same time. It is only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
a question of a few years when the natural supply will be completely
exterminated. The only salvation of the industry in Wareham is to
increase the natural supply by quahaug farming.</p>

<h3><i>Wellfleet.</i></h3>

<p>The town of Wellfleet possesses the finest quahaug industry in Massachusetts.
More men are engaged in the business and the annual production
is larger than that of any other town of the State.</p>

<p>In colonial days the towns of Orleans, Eastham and Wellfleet were
incorporated as one town,&mdash;the town of Eastham. In 1763 an act
was passed incorporating the North Precinct of Eastham into a district
by the name of Wellfleet, "Reserving to the inhabitants of said town
the privileges by them heretofore enjoyed of all ways to and of erecting
houses on the beaches and islands for the convenience of the fishery
of all kinds, and of anchorage and of landing all goods or wares at
any of their common landing places in any of the harbors of said
Eastham in like manner as they might have done if this act had never
been made and passed." By this act were created the two independent
towns of Eastham and Wellfleet, which held in common all fisheries,
thus giving the mutual right of the shellfisheries to both towns.</p>

<p>In 1797 another act of incorporation, separating Orleans from Eastham,
was enacted, which provided that the benefits of the shellfisheries
of these two towns were to be mutually enjoyed.</p>

<p>The result of these two acts was to give Eastham and Wellfleet and
at the same time Eastham and Orleans mutual rights of the shellfishery,
but forbidding mutual shellfisheries between Wellfleet and Orleans.
While this may seem to give theoretically the advantage to Eastham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
actually the town gains nothing in the quahaug fishery, as Orleans has
practically no productive grounds on the bay side, and the Orleans
quahaugers fish in the Eastham waters.</p>

<p>The quahaug territory of Wellfleet comprises about 2,500 acres, and
approximately takes up all the harbor, wherever there are no oyster
grants, running from the "Deep Hole" between Great Island and Indian
Neck southward to the Eastham line. Outside of these limits a
few quahaugs are found on the flats of Duck Creek and along the shore
flats of the town. They are more abundant on the north side of Egg
Island, where they are taken in shallow water with ordinary hand
rakes. The best quahauging is found in the channel extending from an
imaginary line between Lieutenant's Island and Great Beach Hill south
to Billingsgate. The greatest depth at low tide is 4&frac12; fathoms and the
general average is about 3 fathoms. In this channel are found most
of the "little necks," small blunts and small sharps.</p>

<p>Outside of the oyster grants, quahaugs are found south of Great
Island, north of Billingsgate Island on the west side of the harbor, on
Lieutenant's Island bar and at the mouth of Blackfish Creek. A few
quahaugs, both sharps and blunts, are raked with 25-foot rakes in the
shallow water 6 to 8 feet near the beach, usually on a sandy bottom.</p>

<p>The principal market for Wellfleet quahaugs is New York, though
many are sent to Boston and other parts of the country, even to the
middle west. Quahaugs have been shipped from Wellfleet to Milwaukee
and arrived in good condition after ten days.</p>

<p>The annual production is 33,000 bushels, one-sixth of these, 5,500
bushels, being "little necks." There were 140 men engaged in the
fishery in 1906, and 145 permits were granted in 1907. The average
yield for a day's raking is 4 bushels, although an exceptional quahauger
can sometimes rake 7 bushels.</p>

<p>Practically all the raking is done in deep water, with rakes the
handles of which are often 47 feet long. Each quahauger has a set of
handles of various lengths for different depths of water. Both power
boats and "cats" are used here in quahauging, the power boats possessing
considerable advantage over the sail boat. Thirty-eight power boats
and 62 sail boats, both single and double manned, are used at Wellfleet.</p>

<p>At present there is every indication of a declining fishery. Until
the last three years the industry has been steadily on the increase since
1894. The maximum production was reached a few years ago, and the
industry is slowly on the decline, unless the opening up of new beds
gives it a fresh start. Unfortunately, all the quahaugers do not realize
the possibility of this seemingly inexhaustible supply giving out, and
believe it will continue forever; but any one can see that it is impossible
for the natural supply to continue when such inroads are yearly
made, and that it is only a question of time when the best business
asset of the town will become extinct.</p>

<p>For years there has been an antagonistic feeling between the qua<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>haugers
and the oystermen, due to the conflicting interests of these
industries. Although the quahaug territory has been narrowed down
by the giving of oyster grants in the harbor, the quahaug fishery has not
suffered severely, as the poorer quahaug grounds were alone granted,
with the idea that more money could be made by using these for oyster
culture. Although these grants were laid out in good faith, injustice in
many instances has been done the quahaug industry; but on the whole
the change has been for the benefit of the town. In the broad waters of
Wellfleet harbor there is room for both industries, and there is no reason
why both should not prosper if wisely regulated, without the intervention
of town politics. At present this antagonism has hurt the
interests of both, and it is manifestly unfair that either should drive
the other out while there is room for both to prosper.</p>

<p>Wellfleet is the only town that can boast of a quahaug club. This
club was formed in 1904, and had an enrollment of practically all the
quahaugers.</p>

<p>Permits are required of every man engaged in the quahaug fishery.
These cost $1 apiece, and are granted on application to any one who
has been a resident of the town for six months. These permits are to
be obtained each year, on or before May 1, after which date an additional
charge of 50 cents is made for collecting. No person without a
regular permit is allowed to catch quahaugs for market. Permits were
first issued in 1904.</p>

<p>Section 2 of chapter 269 of the Acts of 1904 is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Section 2.</span> No inhabitant of said towns shall sell or offer for sale little
neck clams or quahaugs which measure less than one and one-half inches
across the widest part, and no person shall in any of said towns sell or offer
for sale little neck clams or quahaugs which measure less than one and
one-half inches across the widest part.</p></div>

<p>This excellent law was passed for the towns of Eastham, Orleans
and Wellfleet, but has never been enforced. Although enacted and
technically lived up to, no measures are made for its enforcement, which
would necessitate a shellfish inspector. This furnishes an example of
the nonenforcement of one of the few good town laws.</p>

<p>Section 4 of chapter 269 of the Acts of 1904 is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Section 4.</span> The selectmen of the said towns may, in their respective
towns, grant licenses or permits for such periods, not exceeding two years,
and under such conditions as they may deem proper, not however covering
more than seventy-five feet square in area, to any inhabitants of the town
to bed quahaugs in any waters, flats and creeks within the town at any
place where there is no natural quahaug bed, not impairing the private
rights of any person or materially obstructing any navigable waters. It
shall be unlawful for any person, except the licensee and his agents, to take
any quahaugs in or remove them from the territory covered by any such
license.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>The above should receive well-deserved praise, as it is one of the
most useful town laws ever enacted in Massachusetts. Each quahauger
is thus enabled to stake off a little plot 75 feet square on the flats,
whereon he can bed his catch whenever the market price is too low for
shipment. This not only makes steadier work for the quahaugers, since
a dull market does not stop digging, as before, but also enables him
to obtain a better price for his quahaugs, and he is not forced to lose
through the wastes of competition.</p>

<p>Quahaugs have always been abundant at Wellfleet. Forty years ago
about 15 men were engaged in the business, and shipped their catch to
Boston by packet boats, quahaugs then wholesaling at 50 cents per
bushel.</p>

<p>In 1879 (report of the United States Fish Commission) Ernest Ingersoll
gives the following account of the quahaug industry at Wellfleet,
which furnishes such an excellent comparison with the present industry
that it is given here:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The early productiveness of Cape Cod is shown by the presence of numerous
shellfish heaps, particularly in Wellfleet and Barnstable harbors, filled
up by the Indians, and consisting almost wholly of the shells of this mollusk.
Though in greatly depleted numbers, the quahaug still survives along
the inside of the Cape, and at Wellfleet has been raked from early times
by the settlers. Mr. F. W. True contributes some notes on this place, from
which I learn that the quahaug fishery as a business there dates from the
beginning of the nineteenth century. It grew in extent until 1863, and
from that time until 1868 the trade was at its height, since when it has
diminished year by year, owing to lack of good market rather than failure
of the supply. Between 1863 and 1869 the average catch each year was
not less than 2,500 bushels. Of this amount a comparatively small part
was consumed at Wellfleet, and the rest were shipped to Boston, Provincetown,
Salem, Newport, Manchester and a few other New England ports.
From 1870 to 1876 the quantity of quahaugs taken per year decreased from
2,500 bushels to 1,800 bushels, and this latter amount has remained constant
to the present year. Of the total catch in 1878, fully one-half, or 900
bushels, was consumed in Wellfleet, and the remaining 900 bushels were
shipped to Boston and other neighboring towns. For three years, beginning
with 1876, 75 bushels of quahaugs have been annually shipped to New
York City.</p>

<p>Quahaugs are found in all parts of Wellfleet Bay except in a small spot
near the wharves, called the "Deep Hole," and a similar one on the west
side of the bay. Both of these places are covered with a thick, soft mud.
It is not usual, however, to fish in parts of the bay where the average depth
at low water exceeds 8 feet. Most of the raking is done on the western side.
In ordinary years, quahaug raking is begun the last of March and continues
until the first of October. As a general thing, no raking is done
through the winter months, although in some years a small amount has been
done through holes cut in the ice. The fishermen rake about four tides per
week, beginning at half-ebb and raking to half-flood. The boats used are
either cat boats or yawls rigged with two sails. Each boat carries 1 man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
The rake employed at Wellfleet is described by Mr. True as similar in form
to an oyster rake, but made of steel instead of iron. In former days this
instrument was of iron, the tips of the teeth only being of steel. An
average rake has seventeen teeth, and weighs about 12 pounds. The handle
or tail is of wood, and is about 23 feet long. The baskets in which the
quahaugs are collected and measured are of ordinary manufacture, and hold
about a bushel each; and the whole outfit of a quahaug fisherman does
not cost over $150, and the total amount of capital invested in apparatus
at the present time in Wellfleet does not exceed $800. This amount is
about evenly divided between 5 men, none of whom are engaged in this
fishery more than a part of their time.</p>

<p>Quahaugs are sent to market always in the shell, and packed in second-hand
flour or sugar barrels. The wholesale price of quahaugs for many years
averaged 60 cents per bushel, but in 1879 it fell to 55 cents. One dollar
and seventy-five cents is the average wholesale price per barrel. Quahaugs
retail in Wellfleet at 80 cents per bushel. The usual method of transportation
is by packet, at a cost of 25 cents per barrel.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p></div>

<p>From the account of Mr. Ingersoll the above table has been formulated,
showing the vast increase in the quahaug business of Wellfleet
since 1879, as well as certain changes in the industry. This by no means
proves that the quahaug industry is on the increase; it merely shows
that it has taken a tremendous development since 1879, and the fact
that the quahaug industry of Wellfleet has passed its maximum production
a few years ago and is now on the decline should not be overlooked
in consulting this table, which otherwise would give an erroneous
impression. The changing of the quahaug grounds from shallow to
deeper water alone is a sign of the decline of the industry. The quahaug
industry has developed to its present extent only since 1894, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
comparatively recent. By the opening of the great beds of "little
necks" and quahaugs in the channel and deep water the industry
suddenly became important.</p>

<h3><i>Yarmouth.</i></h3>

<p>The quahaug grounds, which lie mostly in Bass River, are free to
the inhabitants of Dennis and Yarmouth, as these two towns have common
fishery rights. Quahaugs are found in four localities: (1) Bass
River; (2) Mill Creek; (3) Barnstable Bar on the north shore; and
(4) Lewis Bay. The total area is 1,000 acres, which includes all grounds
where there are any quahaugs, as there are now no thick beds. The
average depth of water over the quahaug grounds is 4 feet.</p>

<p>The town law governing the quahaug fishery reads thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All persons other than the inhabitants of the towns of Dennis and Yarmouth
are prohibited from taking clams and quahaugs from the shores and
waters of the town of Yarmouth. Inhabitants of the Commonwealth not
residents of Dennis and Yarmouth may obtain permits of the selectmen to
take sufficient quantity of said shellfish for their family use.</p></div>

<p>The history of the quahaug industry of Yarmouth is one of decline.
The industry has existed for fifteen years, starting in 1892. Mr. Edgar
N. Baker, who has been interested in the business ever since it started,
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the last ten years it is safe to say that the catch has fallen off fully
75 per cent., and nothing but the constant advance in prices and lack of
profitable employment has prompted men to give their attention to this
method of obtaining their "bread and butter." The most conservative
estimate would not put it below 50 per cent.</p></div>

<h2><a name="Scallop_Pecten_irradians" id="Scallop_Pecten_irradians"><span class="smcap">Scallop</span> (<i>Pecten irradians</i>).</a></h2>


<p>The common shallow-water scallop is unknown commercially on the
north shore, occurring only south of Boston. It is usually found in
abundance along the southern shore of Cape Cod, in Buzzards Bay,
and about the islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard.</p>

<p>For the past three years investigations in regard to its growth, habits
and culture have been carried on by the Commissioners on Fisheries
and Game. These investigations are now practically completed. In
another report the whole life history of this bivalve will be given, showing
the application of this scientific study to the existing conditions of
the industry.</p>

<p>The scallop fishery in Massachusetts is only a partial industry, as
it does not concern the whole coast line, but merely the Vineyard Sound
and Buzzards Bay shore. Compared with other States, the production
of Massachusetts is favorable, New York alone exceeding it in output.
The southern coast of Massachusetts is especially adapted for this
shellfish. Its bays, sheltered harbors and inlets afford excellent ground
for the scallop, which requires protection against the heavy seas. Thousands
of acres of eel-grass flats from 1 to 60 feet under water were
formerly covered by beds of scallops, and in parts are still thickly set.
While the extent of the scalloping area is large, only portions are ever
productive at any one time. A set may be in one part this year, and the
next year's spawn may catch in a different place. Thus, while all the
ground is suitable for scallops, only a small part is in productive
operation each year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>While the possibilities of future development are not as alluring as
in the other shellfisheries, yet much can be done to assist nature and
help preserve the supply. Wise laws and well-directed efforts can save
many bushels of the young scallops which yearly die on the exposed
flats where they have set in unfavorable places.</p>

<p><i>Scope of the Report.</i>&mdash;The object of this report is to present certain
information concerning the scallop industry which will be of use to the
scallop fishermen, and of interest to the general public and the consumers.
While the scallop is well known as an article of food, the
majority of people know little about the animal. It will therefore be
necessary in the following report to give brief descriptions of the various
methods used in the capture of this bivalve, in order to make clear
the more technical portions.</p>

<p>The first part of the report considers the general results of the survey,
the history of the industry, the scallop laws, the methods of scalloping
and the statistics of the industry. The second part gives a more
detailed description, the following points being considered under each
town: (1) survey; (2) statistics of industry; (3) town laws; (4)
history.</p>

<p><i>Methods of Work.</i>&mdash;Several difficulties stand in the way of procuring
exact information concerning the scallop industry, especially in regard
to historical data which should show the improvement or decline
of the fishery. The town records are incomplete, lost, or furnish but
slight information. Little has been written about this industry, and
we were thus forced to rely upon the scallopers for information concerning
the history and former production of each town. Fortunately,
the scallop industry is of recent origin (thirty years), and the information
is very nearly correct. By the use of town records, market
reports, records of express shipments, personal surveys and estimates
by the various scallopers, and by all other methods at our command, the
facts of the last few years have been obtained in an approximately
correct form.</p>

<p>The area of the scallop territory was obtained by personal inspection
and calculated by plottings on the maps. In designating the area suitable
for scallops in any town by a certain number of acres or by plottings
on the map, it does not mean that scallops are found each year
over all this territory. Allowances must be made for the uncertainty
of the scallop supply. Some years there will be no scallops; in other
years, plenty. Even when scallops are plentiful, they rarely cover the
whole territory, but are found only in certain parts in different years.
The designation of an area as scallop territory means that scallops have
been found in the past over this territory, and that the natural conditions
of the territory appear favorable for scallops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>The Decline.</i></h3>

<p>The most important questions which first come to mind when considering
the scallop industry of to-day are these three: (1) Has there
been any decline in the industry? If so, how extensive? (2) What
are the causes of the decline? (3) How can the fishery be improved?</p>

<p>I. <i>Extent of the Decline.</i>&mdash;There is no question but that the industry
as a whole has declined. This decline has made itself manifest,
especially in certain localities, <i>e.g.</i>, Buzzards Bay, where until
1907 the entire fishery, except at New Bedford and Fairhaven, had
been totally extinct for the past seven years.</p>

<p>Along the south side of Cape Cod, at Edgartown and Nantucket,
the supply has on the average remained the same. Of course there is
varying abundance each year, but as a whole the industry in these localities
can hardly be said to have declined.</p>

<p>On the other hand, on the north side of Cape Cod we find a marked
decline. A scallop fishery no longer exists at Plymouth, Barnstable
harbor, Wellfleet and Provincetown, though twenty-five years ago these
places boasted of a valuable industry.</p>

<p>So we have to-day in Massachusetts three localities, two of which
show a marked decline in the scallop fishery, while the other shows
some improvement. Of the two depleted areas, the one (north of the
Cape) may never revive the industry; the other (Buzzards Bay) gives
indications that the industry can once more be put on a very profitable
footing. The only thing necessary is perpetual precaution on the part
of the fishermen, in order to prevent this decline. Massachusetts must
not allow the industry to become extinct, as in Rhode Island.</p>

<p>II. <i>Causes of the Decline.</i>&mdash;The causes of the decline of this industry
can be grouped under three heads: (1) natural enemies; (2)
overfishing by man; (3) adverse physical conditions.</p>

<p>The natural enemy of the scallop which works the greatest mischief
is the starfish, or "five finger," as it is often called. The starfish
destroys the scallop in the same manner as it attacks the oyster. The
decline of the scallop fishery in Buzzards Bay is attributed by the
fishermen to the inroads of this pest. Undoubtedly the starfish was the
chief apparent cause, since, according to report, dredges full of starfish
could be hauled up. In other localities in Massachusetts the starfish
has not been so plentiful.</p>

<p>While the main cause of the decline of the natural clam, quahaug and
oyster beds is overfishing by man, the decline of the scallop fishery
cannot be so considered. The scallop has a short life, hardly 25 per
cent. passing the two-year limit; so it does no harm to capture the
marketable scallops which are over sixteen months old, as the scallop
spawns when one year old, and dies a natural death usually before it
reaches a second spawning season. When only old scallops are taken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
as is generally the case, it is probably <i>impossible</i> for man to exterminate
the scallops by <i>overfishing</i>. Unfortunately, in certain localities in the
past there has been a large capture of the "seed" scallop, viz., the
scallop less than one year old, which has not spawned. This has worked
the ruin of the scalloping in these localities. The capture of the
spawners for another year merely makes the next year's set so much
smaller, and causes a rapid decline.</p>

<p>As a rule, it is hardly profitable to catch the "seed" scallop, owing
to its small size. But a direct relation can be established between a high
market price and the capture of seed. When the market price is high
and scallops scarce, it becomes profitable to catch the young "seed."
The present scallop law now defines a "seed" scallop, and forbids its
capture. By protecting the "seed" scallop the State has done all that
at present appears expedient to insure the future of the industry; the
rest lies in the hands of the towns.</p>

<p>So, while the scallop has declined in certain localities, and the decline
has been hastened by unwise capture of the "seed" scallop, the main
decline of the fishery cannot be attributed to wholesale overfishing, as
it is impossible to overfish if only the old scallops (over one year old)
are taken; for, unlike most other animals, the scallop usually breeds
but once, and its natural period of life is unusually brief. These
scallops, if not taken, will die, and prove a total loss; so every fisherman
should bear in mind that, as long as the "seed" scallops are protected,
severe fishing of large scallops is not likely to injure the future
scallop industry.</p>

<p>The principal causes of the decline of the fishery, besides the inroads
of man, are best termed "adverse physical conditions." Severe winters,
storms, anchor frost, etc., work destruction upon the hapless scallop.
The "infant mortality" is especially great.</p>

<p>As the scallop dies before reaching its second birthday, only one set
of scallops spawn in any one season. There are never two generations
of scallops spawning at one time. I quote from Ernest Ingersoll in
this connection:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This represents a case where the generations follow one another so rapidly
that there are never two ranks, or generations, in condition to reproduce
their kind at once, except in rare individual instances, since all, or nearly
all, of the old ones die before the young ones have grown old enough to
spawn. If such a state of affairs exists, of course any sudden catastrophe,
such as a great and cold storm during the winter, or the covering of the
water where they lie for a long period with a sheet of ice, happening
to kill all the tender young (and old ones, too, often) in a particular district,
will exterminate the breed there; since, even if the older and tougher
ones survive this shock, they will not live long enough, or at any rate,
will be unable to spawn again, and so start a new generation.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>The set of young scallops is abundant in shallow water upon the
eel-grass flats, which often, as is the case of the Common Flats at
Chatham, are exposed at extremely low tides. A severe winter often
kills off all the "seed" thus exposed. In this case no spawn is obtained
the following summer, causing the suppression of the scallop
fishery in that locality for at least a few years, and possibly its permanent
extinction.</p>

<p>III. <i>Improvement; restocking Barren Areas.</i>&mdash;The scallop industry,
unlike the clam and quahaug, offers but little inducement to private
enterprise. For successful private culture small bays or coves would
be needed, and suitable areas are very scarce. The scallop offers better
opportunity for communal culture, <i>i.e.</i>, by towns.</p>

<p>There is but one way now known of artificial propagation for the
scallop industry, and that is by transplanting in the fall the abundant
set from the exposed places to the deeper water before the seed is killed
by the winter. It is merely assisting nature by preventing a natural
loss, and in no sense can properly be termed propagation. It is merely
a preventive, and money used in this way to preserve the scallops is
well expended. Usually the set is abundant, and can be transferred
in large numbers. This is the only practical method now known of
increasing our scallop supply, though it is hoped in the future that
other methods may be devised.</p>

<p>In connection with the above comes the question, if we can thus
preserve scallops doomed to destruction, will it not be profitable to
transplant scallops to places where the scalloping has been exterminated
by various causes, and by means of these "seeders" furnish succeeding
generations which may populate the barren areas? This plan is practical
and feasible, and should be given due consideration. Why should
not scallops be transplanted to our Buzzards Bay harbors, to again
restock these areas? Often the attempt might fail, but there is bound
to be success if there is perseverance. The best time to plant these
scallops is in the fall, as a double service will be given: (1) preservation
from destruction of the seed scallops; (2) furnishing spawn and
young in the barren locality. Ingersoll speaks of the restocking of
Oyster Bay in 1880:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the spring of 1880 eel grass came into the bay, bringing young scallops
[the eel grass carries the scallops attached to it by the thread-like
byssus]; thus the abundance of that year was accounted for, though there
had not been a crop before in that bay since 1874.</p></div>

<p>If such a restocking can be accomplished by nature, it can be done
with more certain effect with man's assistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>The Industry.</i></h3>

<p>I. <i>The Methods.</i>&mdash;The methods of scalloping follow the historical
rise of the fishery. As the industry grew more and more important,
improvements became necessary in the methods of capture, and thus,
parallel with the development of the industry, we can trace a corresponding
development in the implements used in the capture of the
scallop.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Gathering by Hand.</i>&mdash;When the scallop was first used as an
article of food, the primitive method of gathering this bivalve by hand
was used. This method still exists on the flats of Brewster, and often
in other localities after heavy gales wagons can be driven to the beach
and loaded with the scallops which have been blown ashore.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Scoop Nets.</i>&mdash;This hand method was not rapid enough for the
enterprising scallopers, and the next step in the industry was the use
of scoop nets, about 8 inches in diameter, by which the scallops could
be picked up in the water. These nets were attached to poles of various
lengths, suitable to the depth of water. "This method," writes
Ingersoll, "was speedily condemned, however, because it could be
employed only where scallops are a foot thick and inches in length,
as one fisherman expressed it."</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>The Pusher.</i>&mdash;The next invention was the so-called "pusher."
The "pusher" consists of a wooden pole from 8 to 9 feet long, attached
to a rectangular iron frame 3 by 1&frac12; feet, upon which is fitted
a netting bag 3 feet in depth. The scalloper, wading on the flats
at low tide, gathers the scallops by shoving the "pusher" among the
eel grass. When the bag is full, the contents are emptied into the dory
and the process repeated. The scallopers who use the "pusher" go
in dories, which are taken to the various parts of the scalloping ground
and moved whenever the immediate locality is exhausted. This method
is in use to-day, but is applicable only to shallow flats, and can be
worked only at low tide, where dredging is impossible. It is hard
work, and not as profitable as the better method of dredging. This
method of scalloping is used chiefly at Chatham, Dennis and Yarmouth;
occasionally it is used at Nantucket and other towns.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Dredging.</i>&mdash;The greater part of the scallop catch is taken by
dredging, which is the most universal as well as the most profitable
method. The dredge, commonly pronounced "drudge," consists of
an iron framework about 3 by 1&frac12; feet, with a netting bag attached,
which will hold from one to two bushels of scallops. Cat boats, carrying
from 6 to 10 dredges, are used for this method of scalloping. These
boats, with several "reefs," cross the scallop grounds pulling the
dredges, which hold the boat steady in her course. A single run with
all the dredges overboard is called a "drift." The contents of all
the dredges is said to be the result or catch of the "drift."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>When the dredges are hauled in they are emptied on what is known
as a culling board. This board runs the width of the boat, projecting
slightly on both sides. It is 3 feet wide, and has a guide 3 inches
high along each side, leaving the ends open. The scallops are then
separated from the rubbish, such as seaweed, shells, mud, etc., while
the refuse and seed scallops are thrown overboard by merely pushing
them off the end of the board. Each catch is culled out while the dredges
are being pulled along on the back "drift," and the board is again
clear for the next catch. The culled scallops are first put in buckets
and later transferred either to bushel bags or dumped into the cockpit
of the boat.</p>

<p>Two men are usually required to tend from 6 to 8 dredges in a large
cat boat, but often one man alone does all the work. This seems to
be confined to localities, as at Nantucket nearly all the cat boats have
two men. At Edgartown the reverse is true, one man to the boat,
though in power dredging two men are always used.</p>

<p>Several styles of dredges are used in scalloping, as each locality has
its own special kind, which is best adapted to the scalloping bottom
of that region. Four different styles are used in Massachusetts, two of
which permit a subdivision, making in all six different forms. Each
of these dredges is said by the scallopers using them to be the best;
but for all-round work the "scraper" seems the most popular.</p>

<p>(1) <i>The Chatham or Box Dredge.</i>&mdash;As this dredge was first used in
Chatham, the name of the town was given to it, to distinguish it from
the other styles. At the present time its use is confined to Chatham and
the neighboring towns of the Cape. With the exception of a very few
used at Nantucket, it is not found elsewhere in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The style of the box dredge is peculiar, consisting of a rectangular
framework, 27 by 12 inches, of flat iron 1 by &frac14; inches, with an oval-shaped
iron bar extending back as a support for the netting bag, which
is attached to the rectangular frame. To the side of the rectangular
frame is attached a heavy iron chain about 4 feet long, to which is
fastened the drag rope.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Scraper.</i>&mdash;As can be seen by the illustration, this style
of dredge consists of a rigid iron frame of triangular shape, which
has a curve of nearly 90&deg; at the base, to form the bowl of the dredge.
Above, a raised cross bar connects the two arms, while at the bottom
of the dredge a strip of iron 2 inches wide extends from arm to arm.
This strip acts as a scraping blade, and is set at an angle so as to dig
into the bottom. The top of the net is fastened to the raised cross bar
and the lower part to the blade.</p>

<p>The usual dimensions of the dredge are: arms, 2&frac12; feet; upper
cross bar, 2 feet; blade, 2&frac12; feet. The net varies in size, usually
holding about a bushel of scallops, and running from 2 to 3 feet in
length. Additional weights can be put on the cross bar when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
scalloper desires the dredge to scrape deeper. A wooden bar, 2 feet
long, buoys the net.</p>

<p>Two styles of this dredge are in use. At Nantucket the whole net
is made of twine, while at Edgartown and in Buzzards Bay the lower
part of the net is formed of a netting of iron rings, the upper half
of the net being twine. The iron rings are supposed to stand the wear
better than the twine netting. This difference seems to be merely a
matter of local choice. The "scraper" is perhaps the dredge most
generally used, as, no matter what style is in use, a scalloper generally
has a few "scrapers" among his dredges.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The "Slider."</i>&mdash;The principle of the "slider" is the reverse
of the "scraper," as the blade is set either level or with an upward
incline, so the dredge can slide over the bottom. This dredge is used
on rough bottom and in places where there is little eel-grass. In some
dredges the blade is rigid, but in the majority the blade hangs loose.</p>

<p>The "slider" used at Edgartown differs from the "scraper" by having
perfectly straight arms and no curved bowl, the blade being
fastened to the arms in a hook-and-eye fashion. The dimensions of
this dredge are the same as those of the "scraper," although occasionally
smaller dredges are found.</p>

<p>(4) <i>The "Roller" Dredge.</i>&mdash;This style of dredge is used only in the
town of Mattapoisett, where the scallopers claim it is the most successful.
The dredge is suitable for scalloping over rough ground, as the
blade of the dredge is merely a line of leads, which roll over the surface
of the ground gathering in the scallops.</p>

<p>The dredge consists of an oval iron frame, 32 by 20 inches, which
acts as the arms, and is attached to another iron frame, 32 by 3 inches.
The blade of the dredge consists of a thin rope with attached leads.
The net is made wholly of twine, and is about 2&frac12; feet long.</p>

<p><i>Scalloping with Power Boats.</i>&mdash;The season of 1907 has witnessed
in Massachusetts the first use of auxiliary power in the scallop fishery.
At Edgartown the main part of the scalloping is now done by power,
which, in spite of the additional expense of 5 gallons of gasolene per
day, gives a proportionately larger catch of scallops. The Edgartown
scallopers claim that their daily catch, using power, is from one-third
to one-half better than under the old method of dredging by sail. Not
only can they scallop when the wind is too light or too heavy for successful
scalloping by sail, but more "drifts" can be made in the same
time. A slight disadvantage of scalloping with power is the necessity
of having two men, as the steering of the power boat demands much
closer attention than the sail boat, which is practically held to a fixed
course by the dredges. A power boat for scalloping possesses only the
disadvantage of additional cost; but it is only necessary to look forward
a few years, when expedition rather than cheapness will be in demand,
to a partial revolution in the present methods of scalloping, whereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the auxiliary cat boat will take the place of the sail boat in the scallop
fishery.</p>

<p>II. <i>Preparing the Scallop for Market.</i> (1) <i>The "Eye."</i>&mdash;The
edible part of the scallop is the large adductor muscle. The rest of
the animal is thrown away, though in certain localities it is used as
fish bait and in others for fertilizer. Why the whole of the animal
is not eaten is hard to say. Undoubtedly all is good, but popular
prejudice, which molds opinion, has decreed that it is bad, so it is
not used as food. This is perhaps due to the highly pigmented and
colored portions of the animal. Nevertheless, there is a decided possibility
that in the future we shall eat the entire scallop, as well as the
luscious adductor muscle.</p>

<p>The adductor muscle is called by the dealers and fishermen the "eye,"
a name given perhaps from its important position in the animal, and
its appearance. The color of the "eye," which has a cylindrical form,
is a yellowish white.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Shanties.</i>&mdash;The catch of scallops is carried to the shanty
of the fisherman, and there opened. These shanties are usually grouped
on the dock, so the catch can be readily transferred. Inside of these
shanties, usually 20 by 10 feet or larger, we find a large bench 3
to 3&frac12; feet wide, running the length of the shanty, and a little more
than waist high. On these benches the scallops are dumped from the
baskets or bags, and pass through the hands of the openers. Under
the bench are barrels for the shells and refuse.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The Openers.</i>&mdash;The openers are usually men and boys, though
occasionally a few women try their hand at the work. Of late years
there has been a difficulty in obtaining sufficient openers, and the scallopers
often are forced to open their own scallops. The openers are
paid from 20 to 30 cents per gallon, according to the size of the
scallops. One bushel of average scallops will open 2&frac12; to 3 quarts
of "eyes." An opener can often open 8 to 10 gallons in a day, making
an excellent day's work. The price now paid is more than double that
paid in 1880, which was 12&frac12; cents per gallon. Some openers are
especially rapid, and their deft movements cause a continual dropping
of shells in the barrel and "eyes" in the gallon measure.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Method of opening the Scallop.</i>&mdash;The opening of a scallop requires
three movements. A flat piece of steel with a sharp but rounded
end, inserted in a wooden handle, answers for a knife. The scallop
is taken by a right-handed opener in the palm of the left hand, the
hinge line farthest away from the body, the scallop in its natural resting
position, the right or smooth valve down. The knife is inserted
between the valves on the right-hand side. An upward turn with a cutting
motion is given, severing the "eye" from the upper valve, while
a flirt at the same moment throws back the upper shell. The second
motion tears the soft rim and visceral mass of the scallop and casts
it into the barrel, leaving the "eye" standing clear. A third move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>ment
separates the "eye" from the shell and casts it into a gallon
measure. Frequently the last two movements are slightly different.
The faster openers at the second motion merely tear off enough of the
rim to allow the separation of the "eye" from the shell, and on the
third movement cast the "eye" in the measure, while the shell with
its adhering soft parts is thrown into the refuse barrel. These last
two motions can hardly be separated, so quickly are they accomplished.</p>

<p>(5) <i>"Soaking."</i>&mdash;The "eye" is then usually put through the following
course of treatment before marketing; the treatment is what
is familiarly known as "soaking." It has been noticed that whenever
salt water products are allowed to soak in fresh water, an increase
of bulk is found. This is due to a change, called osmosis, which causes
the swelling of the tissues. The "eye" can be increased, by the process
of osmosis, to a gain of more than one-third its natural size; that is,
4&frac12; gallons of scallop "eyes" can be increased to 7 gallons by judicious
"feeding" with fresh water. Also, a change has taken place in the
scallops after a few hours' soaking. No longer do we find the poor
yellow-colored small "eye" of the freshly opened scallop, but a beautiful
white, plump "eye," which at once tempts the purchaser. While
these changes have added to the salable properties of the scallop by
beautifying its appearance and increasing its size, the scallop has lost
much of its sweet flavor and freshness.</p>

<p>Practically every scallop sold in the markets or shipped from any
scalloping center is soaked, as the "soaking," if not already done by
the fishermen, is administered by the retail dealers. There are scallopers
who are ready to ship the unsoaked scallops at a proportionate price
the moment the market demands them; but the consumer, through ignorance,
demands the large, nice-appearing "eyes," and thus unwittingly
favors the practice. However, as long as pure water is used and other
sanitary precautions taken, no actual harm may arise from soaking
scallops.</p>

<p>Two methods of swelling scallops are in use. When the scallops
are shipped in kegs, which usually contain 7 gallons, the following
method is applied: 4&frac12; to 5 gallons of "eyes" are placed in each keg,
and are allowed to stand over night in fresh water; in the morning
before shipment more water is added and the keg closed, and by the
time of arrival to the New York or Boston market the scallops have
increased to the full amount of 7 gallons.</p>

<p>The second method of "soaking" is slightly more elaborate. The
eyes are spread evenly in shallow wooden sinks 5 by 3 feet, with just
enough fresh water to cover them, and left over night. In the morning
a milky fluid is drawn off, and the "soaked" scallops are packed for
market in kegs or butter tubs.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Shipment.</i>&mdash;The kegs in which the scallops are shipped cost
30 cents apiece, and contain about 7 gallons. A full keg is known
as a "package." The butter tubs are less expensive, but hold only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
4 to 5 gallons. Indeed, anything which will hold scallops for shipment
is used to send them to market.</p>

<p>When the scallops get to the market they are strained and weighed,
9 pounds being considered the weight of a gallon of meats. In this
way about 6 gallons are realized from every 7-gallon keg. With the
improved methods of modern times scallops can be shipped far west
or be held for months in cold storage, for which purpose unsoaked
scallops are required. Certain firms have tried this method of keeping
the catch until prices were high, but it has not been especially successful.</p>

<p>(7) <i>Market.</i>&mdash;One of the greatest trials to the scallop fisherman
is the uncertainty of market returns when shipping. He does not
know the price he is to receive; and, as the price depends on the supply
on the market, he may receive high wages or he may get scarcely anything.
The wholesale market alone can regulate the price, and the
fisherman is powerless. While this is hard on the scalloper, it does
not appear that at the present time anything can be done to remedy
the uncertainty of return. The scallop returns from the New York
market are usually higher than from the Boston market. The result
of this has been to give New York each year the greater part of the
scallop trade, and practically all the Nantucket and Edgartown scallops
are shipped to New York.</p>

<p>Either from a feeling of loyalty, or because the market returns are
sooner forwarded, or because the express charges are less, Cape Cod
still ships to the Boston market, in spite of the better prices offered
in New York. Why so many Cape scallopers should continue to ship
to Boston, and resist the attractions of better prices, is impossible to
determine, and appears to be only a question of custom.</p>

<p>(8) <i>The Price.</i>&mdash;The price of scallops varies with the supply. The
demand is fairly constant, showing a slight but decided increase each
year. On the other hand, the supply is irregular, some years scallops
being plentiful, in other years scarce.</p>

<p><i>The Maine or Deep-sea Scallop.</i>&mdash;In the Boston market the shallow-water
scallop has a formidable rival in the giant scallop of the Maine
coast, which is nearly twice as large. Nevertheless, the Cape scallop
maintains its superiority and still leads its larger brother in popular
favor, wholesaling at 50 to 70 cents more a gallon. There is no doubt
that this competition has had a tendency to lower the price of the Cape
scallop, possibly accounting for the higher market price in New York.</p>

<p><i>Outfit of a Scalloper.</i>&mdash;While we have traced the scallop from its
capture among the eel-grass to its final disposition, we have not considered
the equipment of the scalloper. The average capital invested
in the business can best be summed up under these two heads,&mdash;the
boat fisherman and the dory fisherman.</p>

<p>III. <i>The Scallop Season.</i>&mdash;There is considerable diversity of opinion
among the scallopers as to when the scallop season should open.
Some advocate November 1 as the opening date, instead of October 1,
as the present law reads; and many arguments are put forth by both
sides.</p>

<p>The class of fishermen who desire November 1 are those who are
engaged in other fishing during the month of October, and either have
to give it up or lose the first month of scalloping. Naturally, they wish
a change, putting forth the additional argument of better prices if
the season begins later. The scalloper who is not engaged in other
fishing of course desires the law to remain as it is at the present time,
claiming that the better weather of October gives easier work, more
working days, and allows no chance of loss if the winter is severe.</p>

<p>Under the present law, the town can regulate the opening of its
season to suit the demands of the market and the desire of the inhabitants.
This does away with the necessity of any State law on this
point, which, under the present system of town control, would be
inadvisable.</p>

<p>The general opinion of the fishermen is in favor of the present date,
October 1. As nearly as could be determined, about 75 per cent. favor
October 1 and 25 per cent. November 1. This sentiment is divided by
localities, as more men were in favor of November 1 at Nantucket
and Edgartown than on Cape Cod and Buzzards Bay, where very few
favored a change.</p>

<p>IV. <i>The Utilization of Waste.</i>&mdash;While it seems an enormous waste
that out of a bushel of scallops only 2&frac12; to 3 quarts of edible meats
are obtained, it is not all absolute loss. Oyster growers buy the shells
for cultch to catch the oyster seed, paying from 3 to 5 cents per bushel.
Other uses are found, such as ornaments and in making shell roads.
The refuse is used for fish bait, and often barrels of it are salted for
this purpose. It is also used in some places for manure for agricultural
purposes.</p>

<p>In the last year a new use for scallop shells has developed. Similar
to the souvenir postal card, scallop shells bound together with ribbon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
and containing miniature photographic views have been put on the
market. Three firms near Boston make a business of this, and use only
the lower or bright valve of the scallop. Certain scallopers furnish
these scallop shells, cleaned of meat, at the rate of $6 per barrel; and,
though it takes considerable time to separate the shells when opening,
the excellent price makes this new industry pay. The question of the
future is to find new and more important uses for our waste sea products.
Some day what is now waste in the scallop industry may be
utilized for the benefit of the public.</p>

<p>V. <i>Food Value.</i>&mdash;As a food the scallop stands ahead of all the
other shellfish, containing much more nourishment than the oyster. The
following figures are from the tables of Professor Atwater, rearranged
by C. F. Langworthy:<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>&mdash;</p>

<h3><i>The Laws.</i></h3>

<p>The State laws regulating the fishery were made for the benefit of
the industry and for the preservation of the "seed" scallop, which
is the only requirement necessary for insuring the future supply.</p>

<p>Each town has charge over its scallop fishery, under the general
shellfish act of 1880, which entrusted all regulation of the shellfisheries
to the selectmen of the towns. The town laws governing the scallop
fishery are by far the most satisfactory of the shellfish laws of the
towns. Although in many respects beneficial, they have certain disadvantages.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>
<p>The main disadvantage of the town laws is found in the jealousy
of neighboring towns. One town may make a law to oppose another
town, and will often injure its own interests thereby. In this connection
the condition at Dennis, during the winter of 1904-05, was an instance.
As scallops were remarkably abundant, the town made by-laws intended
to exclude from its scallop fisheries the residents of other towns.
At the close of the scalloping season, when the ice came, the scallops
were still abundant. The inhabitants of the town thought they could
get the rest next season. They did not know that the scallop does not
live two years. The next year not a single scallop of that set was to
be found; they had died. If other scallopers had been allowed to
go there, thousands of dollars could have been saved, and many scallopers
given employment. This one case illustrates the disadvantages
of town jealousy; and Dennis is by no means to blame, as it merely
protected itself against the similar restrictions of neighboring Cape
Cod towns.</p>

<p>The town laws which benefit the scallop industry are made each year
according to the condition of the industry. Edgartown and Nantucket
have perhaps the best-governed scallop industries. Laws requiring
licenses, regulating the opening of the season and restricting at proper
times the catch, so as to get the best market prices instead of overstocking
the market when the prices are low, are to be recommended
on account of their benefit to the scallopers.</p>


<h3><i>History.</i></h3>

<p>In considering the rise of a fishing industry, it is often difficult to
state exactly the year when the industry started, as there are differences
of opinion as to how large a fishery should be before it could be justly
considered an industry. The scallop fishery has existed for years, but
did not become an established industry of the State before the year
1872. At that time there was hardly any demand for scallops, and the
catch was with difficulty marketed. Since then the market demand
for the scallop has steadily increased, until the supply can hardly meet
the popular demand. It seems almost incredible that the scallop as
an article of food should once have been scorned and practically unknown.</p>

<p>During the years of 1876 and 1877 the industry took a sudden spurt.
At this time the introduction of the dredge on Cape Cod revolutionized
the industry, and made it possible to open up the deep-water fields.
The industry on Cape Cod first started at Hyannis, where a number
of men entered the new business; and for several years the production
increased rapidly, with the opening of new territories and improved
methods of capture. While the natural supply has remained the same
or declined in certain localities, as has been shown in a previous part
of this report, the value of the industry, in regard to the number of
men engaged and capital invested, has steadily increased.</p>

<p>These figures show that the price of scallops varies greatly, dependent
largely upon the amount caught that season; also that there
has been, in spite of the irregularity of the catch, a gradual rise in
prices since 1879, due to a more extensive market.</p>

<p>In considering the scallop industry the following points should be
noted: (1) It has been necessary to record as scallop area any grounds
where scallops have ever been found, in spite of the fact that only
a portion of this total area is in any one year productive. (2) The
boats engaged in the scallop fishery are but transitory capital, which
is utilized, outside of the scallop season, in other fisheries. (3) The
quahaug and scallop fisheries in many towns supplement each other,
as the same men and boats are engaged in both industries. (4) The
length of the season varies in the different localities. In New Bedford
and Fairhaven the scallops are mostly caught in a few weeks, as many
boats enter the business temporarily. This necessarily gives an excess
of invested capital and a small production. In these two towns the
number of scallop licenses are recorded as showing the number of men
engaged in the fishery, while as a fact but a small part of these are
steadily engaged in the industry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Barnstable.</i></h3>

<p>The principal scalloping grounds of the town of Barnstable are
found in Hyannis bay and at Cotuit. Scallops are said to have once
been abundant in Barnstable harbor, on the north side of Cape Cod.
At the present day the scallop is unknown commercially in this locality,
and few are found on the sand flats of the harbor. A. Howard
Clark, in his report on the fisheries of Massachusetts, in 1880, makes
the following statement concerning this industry in Barnstable harbor:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Scallops are abundant along the shores of the harbor, and in 1876 a
party of men from Hyannis established themselves here for the purpose
of gathering them. In 1877 the price of scallops declined very greatly,
forcing these men to abandon their enterprise. The fishery was continued,
however, by two men of Barnstable. In the winter of 1877-78 the latter
shipped 40 half-barrels of "eyes," and during the winter of 1878-79 only
6 half-barrels. They were sent to Boston and New York.</p></div>

<p>This furnishes a concrete example of the extinction of the productive
scallop beds in certain localities. The chances are that a severe
winter or other adverse physical conditions killed all the scallops in
the harbor, and rendered impossible any future supply. Although
Barnstable harbor, with its swift tides, is not suitable for scallops in
all parts, yet there are certain localities where they should thrive. In
no way is it visionary or impossible that by the proper transplanting
of young scallops from the waters on the south side of the Cape, these
"seeders" might furnish other generations of scallops, and revive an
extinct industry. At any rate, the chances for success in this line look
favorable, and should be carefully considered.</p>

<p><i>Hyannis.</i>&mdash;Although the scallop industry on the north coast of the
town is extinct, it still flourishes as of old on the south coast. The
bulk of the business is carried on here, and nearly all the shipments
are made from this town. The scallop territory comprises 2,700 acres,
in the following localities: (1) Lewis Bay; (2) near Squaw's Island;
(3) Hyannisport harbor; and (4) the shore waters. At Hyannisport
small scallops are taken with "pushers" in the shallow water, while
large scallops are taken by dredging in the other three localities. Scallops
are found in different parts and in varying abundance each year.
Practically all this territory as outlined on the map is suitable for
scallops.</p>

<p>Two methods of scalloping are in use at Hyannis: (1) the hand
"pusher," used in shallow water, especially in the harbor at Hyannisport;
(2) dredging. These two methods cover different territories, and
it is possible that one year scallops may be found only on the flats
where it was impossible to dredge with a boat, and another year be
all in the deep water where the "pusher" cannot be used. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
in most years both methods are in use. The dredge most commonly
used is the "scraper," although the Chatham style is found here. Six
to nine are carried by each boat.</p>

<p>Hyannis claims the distinction of shipping the first Cape Cod scallops
to market. This was in 1874, and was the start of a considerable industry
which employed 80 men. There has been more or less scalloping
ever since that time. Ernest Ingersoll, in his report on the scallop
fishery of the United States, in 1880, says in reference to scallop fishing
at Hyannis from 1876 to 1878:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The most northerly locality at which such a fishery exists, as far as I
am informed, is at Hyannis, Mass., and during the winter of 1877 many
persons of all ages and conditions were employed in it there. One firm
fitted up a large house expressly for the business, and employed a large
number of openers. Skiffs, cat-rigged yawl boats, dories and punts, 200
in number, and of every size, shape, form and color, were used; most
of them were flat bottomed, shaped like a flatiron, and therefore very
"tender" when afloat. Each boat carried two dredges, locally termed
"drags." In that year, according to Mr. F. W. True, each of the 200 boats
averaged 120 bushels, or 100 gallons, during the season, which would give
a total of 24,000 bushels, or 20,000 gallons for the fleet. The scallops were
sent to New York and also to Boston, and an average price of $5 per half-barrel
was received. In 1876 the price was $7, and in 1878 only $3.50.
Further inquiries show that this spurt at Hyannis had no precedent, and
has completely died away, so that at present there is no catch there, or at
least no shipments.</p></div>

<p>The 1904-05 fishery was very successful, while the season of 1905-06
proved the reverse. The production for 1905-06 was 1,350 gallons,
valued at $3,200; while the 1906-07 season furnished 1,000 gallons,
worth $2,000. The following notes, made in November, 1905, give the
situation of the industry for that year:&mdash;</p>

<p>The scalloping areas this season have been at Squaw's Island and in
Lewis Bay, the first locality furnishing the better fishing. By the middle
of November both areas were practically exhausted and the season over.
The production to November 12 was 900 gallons. After that time the
shipments to the Boston and New York markets were small and irregular,
in spite of the high price of $3 to $3.50 per gallon.</p>

<p><i>Cotuit.</i>&mdash;In the report of Mr. Ingersoll we find no mention of scalloping
at Cotuit. Either there was none in 1879, or it was too small
to be of any importance. To-day the scalloping is of slight importance,
and practically all is used for home trade. Undoubtedly there has been
but little change in the past twenty-five years. Side by side with the
pigmy scallop industry has grown the oyster industry, which has made
Cotuit famous. Undoubtedly the latter has sapped the strength of the
former by encroaching on its area; but it has always been for the best
interests of the people, as the oyster industry here is far more valuable
than the scallop fishery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>The grounds of Cotuit are quite small, extending over an irregular
strip of 100 acres. The bottom is mostly muddy, and covered with
patches of eel grass. All the rest of the bay, where the bottom is more
suited for oyster culture, is taken up by grants. This scalloping area,
although small, is free to the scallopers of Osterville, Cotuit, Marston's
Mills and Hyannis, and even where heavily set it is soon fished out.</p>

<p>In the years previous to 1904-05 exceptionally fine scalloping had
been reported by the fishermen. The season of 1904-05 was exceptionally
poor, and in 1905-06 hardly any scallops were obtainable. In
1907 scalloping began October 1, and by December 15 all the boats
were hauled up, as the scallops became too scarce for profitable fishing.
Dredging is the only important method employed in the Cotuit fishery,
although a few scallops were picked up on the flats.</p>

<p>A town law forbidding the capture of scallops for market before
December 1 was passed in 1899. This, nevertheless, permitted any resident
of Barnstable, between October 1 and December 1, to catch scallops
for his family use, and for this reason could never be strictly enforced.
In 1907 this law was repealed, as many believed that it was detrimental
rather than helpful to the Cotuit interests, as it gave the Hyannis
scallopers, after they had fished for two months in Hyannis Bay, the
cream of the Cotuit fishery.</p>

<h3><i>Bourne.</i></h3>

<p>The villages of Buzzards Bay, Monument Beach and Cataumet share
the scallop fishery of the town of Bourne, and have had during 1907-08
a successful season for the first time in eight years.</p>

<p>The available scallop territory of the town covers approximately
3,000 acres, extending from Buttermilk Bay along the whole coast of
the town to Cataumet.</p>

<p>The fishing is mostly done by dredging with cat boats, carrying from
six to ten dredges per boat, although a few scallopers dredge with power.
The dredges are generally of the "scraper" type, with the chain bottom,
similar to the dredges used at Edgartown. The scallopers both
open their own catch and hire openers to assist them. Thirty boats,
8 carrying 2 men, and 22 with 1 man, totalling 38 men, are employed
in the scallop fishery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>The industry lasted until Jan. 1, 1908, when the boats were hauled
up for winter. The total estimate for the season is 20,000 bushels, or
12,000 gallons (unsoaked), valued at $15,720. The largest daily catch
recorded for one boat was 72 bushels.</p>

<p>The principal market is New York, though part of the catch is sent
to New Bedford. The price varied from $1.15 to $3 per gallon. The
scallopers claim that they do not soak the scallops, as the "eye" is large
enough to sell well without increasing its size. Undoubtedly soaking
is done to some extent. The scallops are large, opening about 3&frac12;
quarts per bushel.</p>

<p>Twelve hundred dollars are invested in gear and $15,000 in boats,
which vary from $300 to $1,300 in value.</p>

<p>Licenses costing $1 are required by the selectmen of every scalloper.</p>

<p>Here again we find the old tale of the decline of a once prosperous
industry, and new enthusiasm in the success of the 1907-08 season.
The 1906-07 season was an improvement over the previous one, when
eight licenses were issued, allowing a maximum of 1,605 bushels to be
taken. In previous years no licenses were given, as there were no
scallops.</p>


<h3><i>Brewster.</i></h3>

<p>Scalloping at Brewster can hardly be called an industry. Here the
primitive method of picking up the scallops on the exposed flats at
low tide is alone used. The scallops are washed by the heavy seas on
the flats, and can be gathered by men, women and children when the
tide goes down. Somewhere in the deeper water is a bed of scallops,
but in 1905 no one had been able to locate it. In 1905 only one man
made a business of gathering and shipping these scallops. He averaged
2 bushels per tide, going down with a team and carting them to his
house, where he opened them. All shipments were made to Boston,
at an average price of $1.75 to $2. The people pick up many for home
use.</p>


<h3><i>Chatham.</i></h3>

<p>The town of Chatham, situated at the elbow of Cape Cod, possesses
abundant facilities for all the shore fisheries. For the past twenty-five
years the scallop fishery has held almost equal rank with the lobster
and cod fisheries, for which Chatham is noted, and has in many years
furnished employment when other fishing had failed.</p>

<p>Scallops are found only in the southern waters of the town. Between
Inward Point and Harding's Beach many acres of eel-grass flats, sheltered
from the open ocean by Monomoy Island, furnish excellent
grounds for scallops. The entire area of these grounds is approximately
2,000 acres, although this whole territory is never completely stocked
in any one year. During the season of 1907-08 the following places
constituted the scalloping grounds:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Island Flats in Stage Harbor, on the east side of the channel,
opposite Harding's Beach, furnished a number of scallops, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
were rapidly caught the first of the season, as these flats were near the
town. Here the water is not more than 1&frac12; to 2 feet deep at low tide,
and thick eel grass covers the greater part except near the channel.
The first of the season a man could obtain 8 bushels per day, but later
a catch of 2 bushels was considered good.</p>

<p>(2) Directly south of Harding's Beach lies John Perry's flat, commonly
known as "Jerry's," where there has been good scalloping for
many years.</p>

<p>(3) The western half of the Common Flats furnished the best scalloping
in 1907-08, as the scallops, though small (6 pecks to a gallon),
were plentiful. These flats run nearly dry on low course tides, and
are covered with eel grass. Nearly every year there is a heavy set of
scallop seed, which, because of the exposed nature of the flats, is
wholly or partially destroyed. The entire set was destroyed in the winter
of 1904-05, while 30 per cent. was lost in 1906-07.</p>

<p>(4) On the flats just south of Inward Point was another bed of
scallops.</p>

<p>(5) In the bend north of Inward Point scallops were plentiful.</p>

<p>(6) On the northwest edge of the Common Flats scallops can be
dredged over an area of 160 acres at a depth of 5 fathoms. These
are of good size, opening 3&frac12; quarts to the bushel.</p>

<p>Two methods of obtaining scallops are employed: (1) by the use
of the "pusher;" and (2) by dredging. As the "pusher" is used on
the flats at low water where the boats cannot sail, the boat man possesses
the advantage of "pushing" at low tide and dredging at high
water. Sixty per cent. of the scallopers at Chatham go in dories and
use "pushers," as the Common Flats afford excellent opportunity for
this sort of fishing; the remaining 40 per cent. scallop in boats, using
"pushers" to a limited extent. Four to six box dredges are used for
each boat, the smaller boats carrying four, the larger six.</p>

<p>Last season 34,615 gallons, valued at $45,345, were shipped to Boston
and New York. Shipments are made in butter tubs, containing 4 to
6 gallons each.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>The larger scallops in the deep water are from 2&frac12; to 2&frac34; inches in
length, taking 5 pecks to open a gallon of "eyes." On the flats are
smaller scallops, from 2 to 2&frac14; inches in length, of which 6&frac12; pecks are
required to make a gallon. About 4,000 gallons were bought in Chatham
by two dealers, paying $1.30 per gallon; the rest were shipped to
Boston and New York by the individual scallopers, shipments being
made semiweekly to New York. The scallops were shipped in butter
tubs containing from 4 to 6 gallons, on which the express charges were:
to New York, 65 cents; to Boston, 35 cents. The 1907-08 production
was 20,000 gallons, valued at $40,000.</p>

<p>In 1905-06 practically all the catch were "seed" scallops of the
set of 1905; only about 5 per cent. of the catch were scallops of the
1904 set. Owing to the exceptional cod fishing, only 15 men made a
business of scalloping, going mostly one man to a boat, and averaging
3&frac12; bushels per day after the scalloping "struck in," Dec. 1, 1905. The
high prices alone made it profitable to catch these small scallops, which
gave only 3 pints of "eyes" to a bushel of shells,&mdash;just one-half the
amount yielded by a bushel of large scallops. The fishermen were all
from South and West Chatham. The entire catch was estimated at
2,800 gallons.</p>


<h3><i>Dennis.</i></h3>

<p>The scallop grounds of Dennis and Yarmouth are common property
for the inhabitants of both towns, while other towns are excluded from
the fishery. The West Dennis scallopers fish mostly on the Yarmouth
flats at the mouth of Parker River, and between Bass and Parker rivers
on the shore flats. There is also scalloping along the shore on the
Dennis grounds. These grounds are for the "pushers." Dredging is
carried on at Dennisport, and the boats cover a wide territory at some
distance from the shore. The town possesses a large area, which either
has scattering scallops or is well stocked one year and barren the next.
Nearly 2,250 acres of available territory is included in the waters of
the town. The flats, which are of sand with thick or scattering eel
grass, according to the locality, afford a good bottom for scallops.
Were it not for the eel grass, the scallops would perish by being washed
on the shore by southerly winds.</p>

<p>Thirty men make a business of scalloping in the town of Dennis, 22
from Dennisport and 8 from West Dennis. At Dennisport scalloping
is practically all done by dredging, while at West Dennis scallops are
all taken by the use of "pushers." At Dennisport 9 boats, 3 sail and
6 cat boats, with power, carrying 18 men, are employed in the business.
Here also are 4 dory scallopers. At West Dennis the scallopers go
mostly in pairs, using only 5 dories.</p>

<p>The dredges used at Dennisport are similar to the Chatham dredge.
At Dennisport the scallopers open the scallops and also employ openers,
while at West Dennis the scallopers do the entire work.</p>

<p>In 1907-08 the production was 2,950 gallons, valued at $3,865. Scal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>lops
were shipped to the New York and Boston markets, although the
greater part of the catch went to New York.</p>

<p>The scallops taken at Dennisport are large, opening 3 quarts to
the bushel. At West Dennis, where the fishing is done in the shallow
water, the scallops are somewhat smaller, yielding only 2&frac12; quarts to
the bushel.</p>

<p>During the month of November large quantities of scallops were
blown ashore at Dennisport, and it is said that as many as 72 bushels
were gathered by one man in a day.</p>

<p>Permits are required for scalloping, but are issued free of charge
by the selectmen. Dennis and Yarmouth have common scallop fishery
rights, the town scallop regulation reading as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All persons other than the inhabitants of the towns of Dennis and Yarmouth
are prohibited from taking scallops from the shores and waters of
the town of Yarmouth excepting for their family use, and in no case without
a permit.</p></div>

<p>During the season of 1904-05 there existed off Dennisport one of
the largest beds of scallops ever known in Massachusetts. Not only
was it extensive, but the scallops were very numerous. An enormous
yield was the result, affording great profit to a large number of scallopers,
and bringing into the town thousands of dollars. It was stated
by the scallopers that when the scalloping ceased because of the severe
winter and ice the number of scallops appeared in no way diminished.
During the season the catch averaged over 25 bushels per boat. Prospects
looked good for the following season, as the fishermen expected
the scallops to live until the next year. Unfortunately, the life of a
scallop is less than two years, and before spring practically the whole
of this large bed was dead,&mdash;a heavy loss to the fishing interests of
the town and of the State.</p>

<p>In cases like this the exclusion of scallopers from the neighboring
towns, through the present system of town laws, has resulted in severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
economic and financial loss to the State, as many more scallops could
have been captured without injury to the future supply if more fishermen
had been given an opportunity to enjoy this fishery.</p>

<p>The following season, 1905-06, presented a marked contrast to that
of 1904-05. Some adverse conditions had injured the set of 1905,
and as a result there were scarcely any adult scallops. By January 1
the scallops of the 1906 set had become large enough in certain localities
to permit capture. Owing to the high prices, these scallops, less
than eight months old ("seed" scallops), were profitable to catch,
and the season's catch at Dennisport after January 1 consisted of these
young scallops. At that time the present "seed" scallop law was not
in force, so the capture of these scallops was entirely legal.</p>

<p>About 6 men were engaged during 1905-06 in scalloping at Dennisport.
The scallops were obtained by dredging in the deeper water. The
average catch was 3 to 4 bushels per day. The 1906-07 season was
hardly above the average. At West Dennis 8 men were engaged in
scalloping on the flats with "pushers." The scallops were small, averaging
about 2 inches in width. It is only once every three or four years
that West Dennis scallops are in the deep water where it is necessary
to dredge them; usually the scallops are found on the shallow-water flats.
The 1907-08 season is the best season the town has had since 1904-05.</p>


<h3><i>Dartmouth.</i></h3>

<p>A few scallops are occasionally found in Slocum's River and other
places, but in no quantity to furnish any commercial fishery.</p>


<h3><i>Eastham.</i></h3>

<p>The scalloping grounds are on the west side of the town, about half
a mile out. During the season of 1906-07, 6 men, working at intervals
during the winter, managed to take a total of 500 bushels from these
flats.</p>


<h3><i>Edgartown.</i></h3>

<p>Edgartown, situated at the eastern end of Martha's Vineyard, possesses
extensive scallop grounds, and is one of the leading towns in the
production of this shellfish. This fishery, even more important than
the quahaug industry, furnishes steady winter employment for a large
number of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>The important grounds are in Cape Poge Pond and in Edgartown
harbor, while occasionally beds of scallops, especially "seed," are found
in Katama Bay. These grounds comprise an area of 2,000 acres, chiefly
of grass bottom.</p>

<p>At Edgartown scalloping is done both with sail and with power boats,
which are generally auxiliary cat boats, though power dories are used
to some extent. All but two of the power boats are doubly manned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
while the sail boats carry but one man. Eleven sail and 15 power boats,
employing 39 men, are engaged in the fishery.</p>

<p>Two kinds of dredges are used, the "scraper" for scalloping in the
eel grass and the "slider" for clean surface. The depth of water
over the scallop beds is not more than 18 feet, necessitating 10&frac12; fathoms
of rope. The price of a dredge, including rope, is about $3, which is
cheaper than in the Buzzards Bay towns. Each power boat uses six
to eight, which are held out by "spreaders," poles extending from the
sides of the boat, in order that the dredges may cover more ground
and not trail behind one another.</p>

<p>The greater part of the scalloping is done by power, and, in spite
of the extra cost of nearly 90 cents per day, the proportionate increase
makes this method more profitable; it is claimed to increase the catch
about one-third. Scalloping with power necessitates the services of
two men, as one man has to cull while the other steers. At the end
of the "drift" the boat is stopped, and both men cull. With sail,
culling can be done when dredges are overboard. When two men scallop,
the owner of the boat takes three-fifths while his partner shares
two-fifths of the profit.</p>

<p>Twenty-five to 30 openers prepare the scallop for market during
the afternoons and evenings. These are paid at the rate of 25 cents
per gallon, and average about $1.50 per day, a good opener cutting
out a gallon of "eyes" in an hour. Small scallops open 700 "eyes"
per gallon; the larger ones, 500.</p>

<p>The 1907-08 season was successful, as the scallops were plentiful, the
daily catch per boat running between 5 and 50 bushels. About 17,000
gallons, valued at $22,270, were shipped between Oct. 1, 1907, and
April 1, 1908.</p>

<p>Shipments are made mostly to the New York market; a very few to
Boston market. The freight charges on a keg, which weighs about 70
pounds, is 55 cents. In warm weather scallops are sent by express,
the charges being 80 cents. The scallops are packed in butter tubs
of large size, averaging from 6 to 7 gallons, and costing 8 cents apiece.
These are obtained second hand from the grocery stores at New Bedford.
The tubs are packed full and closed tightly. By the time the
scallops arrive at market they are reduced in quantity by the jarring,
in warm weather from 7 to 6 gallons, and in cold from 7 to 6&frac12;. Returns
from the market are made in about a week. Scallops can be held
back for better prices three to four days in warm weather, and about
seven in cold.</p>

<p>By vote of the town, the season for several years has been open one
month later than the State season. Shellfish permits costing $2 are
required of every scalloper. The daily catch for one man is restricted
to 25 bushels.</p>

<p>Edgartown was one of the pioneer towns in the State in the scallop
fishery, and as early as 1875 scallops were shipped to the market. The
industry has maintained a steady supply, and has not shown the great
variation of the Cape and Buzzards Bay fisheries. This is due perchance
to the natural conditions, which render favorable the maintenance
of an extensive industry.</p>

<p>The last four seasons have been very successful, as when scallops
were scarce the increased price more than made up for the diminished
supply. The 1904-05 season was favorable, but, owing to the severe
winter, fishing ceased about January 1, although scallops were plentiful
both in Cape Poge Pond and Edgartown harbor. In 1905-06 scallops
were found only in Cape Poge Pond, as the previous severe winter
had killed all the harbor "seed." This season was most successful, as
Nantucket and Edgartown, owing to the scarcity of scallops in other
localities, received very high market prices. Scallops were more abundant
in 1906-07, but the lower prices made the industry less prosperous
than in the previous season.</p>

<h3><i>Fairhaven.</i></h3>

<p>Fairhaven possesses, with New Bedford, the scalloping grounds of
the Acushnet River, and in addition a much larger territory around
Sconticut Neck and West Island. The scalloping territory comprises
about 2,500 acres, most of which is unproductive or productive only at
intervals.</p>

<p>The town charges $1 for the license to each scalloper. Seventy-three
licenses were issued in 1906-07. This is a larger number than has been
issued in recent years. The highest number ever issued was 80.</p>

<p>The capital invested is transitory, for the season, as in New Bedford,
usually lasts only three weeks. Possibly $14,000 is invested in this way
in boats and gear.</p>

<p>In a good season as high as 2,000 gallons have been shipped in a
week. The average season hardly produces this amount in the whole
three weeks. In the season of 1907-08, 1,300 gallons were shipped.
Some years ago the starfish was a source of damage to the fishery, but
of late years it has attracted little notice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>We find the following account of the scallop fishery of Fairhaven
written by A. Howard Clark in 1879:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ten boats took 2,100 bushels of scallops in 1880. Fourteen men with 10
boats dredge for scallops from the middle of October to the middle of
January. Great quantities are found in the Acushnet River, as well as
along the western shore of the bay. A small dredge, holding about a
bushel, is used. It is made with an oval-shaped iron frame, 3&frac12; feet in
length. Wire netting is used in the front part and twine at the back.
Small sail boats, each with two men, fish with from one to twelve of these
dredges in tow, sailing with just enough sheet to allow a slow headway. As
soon as a dredge is filled, the men "luff up," haul in, empty, and go on.
These little boats take from 10 to 75 bushels a day. If the breeze be
unfavorable, one man takes the oars while the other tends the dredges.</p></div>

<p>The amount of production at the present time is about the same,
or even more, than the figures given for 1879. In all other respects
the industry has changed. Five times as many men now work at the
business, while more boats and capital are invested. This looks as if
the industry had improved. The industry as regards the methods of
capture has improved, but the actual production has remained the same.
Now the season lasts barely three weeks, whereas twenty-five years ago
with few men it lasted four months.</p>


<h3><i>Fall River District.</i></h3>

<p>No scallop fishery exists in these waters at the present time. In
1879, 800 gallons were taken from this region. This furnishes an excellent
illustration of the total decline of the scallop fishery in certain
localities.</p>


<h3><i>Falmouth.</i></h3>

<p>The town of Falmouth cannot be said to support any scallop industry
of importance. Each year in Squeteague Pond, Wild Harbor, North
Falmouth and in West Falmouth harbor a few scallops can be found;
but these are used only for limited local consumption, and usually are
very scarce. Scallops are occasionally present in small quantities in
Waquoit Bay.</p>


<h3><i>Harwich.</i></h3>

<p>The scallop territory of Harwich covers an extensive area on the
south side of the town, and in some places extends for a distance of
from 2 to 3 miles out from shore. Usually the scallops are found, as
in the last season (1907-08), outside the bar, at a distance of 3 miles
from shore, where they can be taken only by dredging from sail or
power boats. The intervening body of water sometimes contains a few
scallops in a quantity to make a commercial fishery. The total area
of the scallop grounds is about 3,200 acres. The bottom is mostly
sandy, with patches of eel grass.</p>

<p>All the scallops are caught by dredging, as the water is too deep for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
any other method. Twelve men were engaged in the fishery during the
1907-08 season. The boats, 7 in number, consisted of 3 power and
4 sail; 5 were manned by 2 men, 2 were sailed singly. The dredges
used here are the same style as the Chatham dredge.</p>

<p>The 1907-08 production was 2,170 gallons, valued at $2,843. The
scallops were shipped to the Boston and New York markets, the greater
part being shipped to New York, at an average price of $1.30 per
gallon. The scallops taken in 1907-08 were large, opening 3&frac12; quarts
to the bushel.</p>

<p>For the last two years there has been practically no scallop fishery.
The 1904-05 season was the last successful season, when the large bed
of scallops was found off Dennis. The 1907-08 season, however, has
been fairly good, and it is thought that the following year may be as
successful.</p>


<h3><i>Marion.</i></h3>

<p>Marion was included in the general revival of the scallop fishery
which came to Buzzards Bay during the past season of 1907-08, and
for the first time in eight years has had a successful scallop season.</p>

<p>The scallop grounds of the town extend over an area of 1,500 acres,
situated on both sides of Great Neck, and extending from the Wareham
line to Aucoot Cove.</p>

<p>All scalloping is done by dredging. The fishery can be divided into
two classes: (1) the boat fishery; (2) the skiff fishery. Under the
first class comes the cat boat and sloop, carrying six dredges; while
the second class consists of the small sail skiffs, with one dredge. The
skiff scalloper rows or sails, as the wind permits, and with his one
dredge makes an average catch of 3 bushels per day. Forty-four men,
using 16 sail and power boats and 24 skiffs are engaged in the fishery.
The business likewise requires the services of nearly 24 openers.</p>

<p>About two-thirds of the dredges are of the "scraper" type, with
chain netting; the rest "sliders," with loose blades. A very few
"roller" or "lead" dredges are used.</p>

<p>The production for 1907-08 was 7,000 gallons, valued at $9,170.
The scallops were mostly sent to the New Bedford market. The scallops
are of two sizes: the smaller, which are taken in the shallow water,
open only 2&frac12; quarts per bushel, while in the deeper water the larger
scallops yield about 3&frac12; quarts. The rest of the body of the scallop,
after the removal of the eye, is saved for bait at Marion, the scalloper
receiving 30 cents per bucket.</p>

<p>The three towns of Marion, Mattapoisett and Rochester have common
fishery rights, as all three were included in the original town of Rochester.
In 1852 Marion became an independent town, and in 1857 Mattapoisett
was likewise separated from Rochester. Until 1893 Marion and
Mattapoisett had separate fishery rights, Rochester having mutual rights
with both. Since then the fishery of these towns has been common to all
three. Every scalloper is required to have a permit, the boatmen paying
$2, the skiff scallopers $1, respectively.</p>

<p>The scallop industry supplanted the waning oyster industry at Marion
some twelve years ago, and for a time it flourished greatly. The abundance
of scallops and extent of the grounds furnish excellent scalloping.
After a few very successful years the industry suddenly died out and
became practically extinct. The direct cause is claimed by the scallopers
to have been the starfish, which came in the harbor in great
abundance at the time of the decline of the industry. Up to this
season but little scalloping had been done for several years, and not
a single permit was issued for the season of 1906-07.</p>


<h3><i>Mashpee.</i></h3>

<p>The scallop territory of Mashpee lies in the Popponesset River and
Bay, comprising at most 200 acres. For the last six years there has
been no scallop industry in the town. A few scallops are occasionally
taken for home consumption.</p>


<h3><i>Mattapoisett.</i></h3>

<p>The scallop territory of Mattapoisett, comprising an area of 1,200
acres, much of which is open and exposed, is in general confined to the
following localities: Nasketucket Bay, Brant Bay, Brant Island Cove,
Mattapoisett harbor, Pine Neck Cove and Aucoot Cove. The location
and extent of these grounds are indicated on Map 8.</p>

<p>Dredging is the only method of scalloping used in Mattapoisett.
Small cat boats and a few power boats are employed in the fishery.
The "roller" dredge is the most popular style with the Mattapoisett
scallopers, who claim that on the uneven bottom this dredge is the most
successful. This town is the only locality in the State where this kind
of dredge is used. The cost of a dredge completely rigged with rope,
which is often 15 fathoms long, is $4.50, and 8 to 10 dredges are used
for each boat.</p>

<p>During the 1907-08 season the production was 5,000 gallons, valued
at $6,550. These were mostly marketed at New Bedford, where they
were purchased unsoaked by the New Bedford Fish Company. At the
first part of the season it was not uncommon for a boat to catch 25
bushels per day, but as the season progressed the size of the catch
gradually diminished. The scallops were large, opening 3 quarts to
the bushel.</p>

<p>Nantucket is one of the leading towns of the State in the scallop
fishery. The grounds lie both in Nantucket harbor and in Maddequet
harbor on the west end of the island. The former of these is the larger
and more important, as the fishery is near the town. When the
scallops become scarce in Nantucket harbor, the scallopers adjourn
to the fresher beds of Maddequet. Nantucket harbor contains approximately
3,000 acres of scallop territory; Maddequet and Muskeget, 1,500
acres.</p>

<p>Practically all the scalloping is done by dredging from sail boats,
employing about 99 men in the fishery. The dredges are of the "slider"
and the "scraper" types, the iron frames of which cost $1.50 and the
netting bags 30 cents. From 6 to 10 of these are used per boat, and
are dragged by 7 fathoms of 15-thread rope. Five regular openers are
hired, who receive from 20 to 25 cents per gallon, according to the size
of the scallops. A few scallops are taken in the shallow water by
the dory fishermen with "pushers," which are locally known as "scoops."
These differ from the Cape Cod "pusher," being more rounded and
smaller in size.</p>

<p>Shipments were made by express to New York and Boston, the
charges to New York being 95 cents, to Boston 55 cents per keg. The
greater part was shipped to New York market. The scallops were
shipped mostly in 7-gallon kegs, which cost 33 cents apiece. About
30 New York and 20 Boston firms receive shipments from the Nantucket
scallopers.</p>

<p>Two kinds of scallops, the large "channel" and the small or "eel
grass," are obtained. The small scallops are more numerous than the
large, but are naturally less desirable.</p>

<p>Of late years the scallopers have taken an interest in protecting the
scallop. Many scallopers when fishing in shallow water "cull out"
the small "seed" scallops, and, instead of returning them to the shallow
water, transplant them to the deep water of the channel, where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
are not only protected in case of severe winter, but produce a larger
scallop the following year. This is the only attempt at protecting
the scallop ever made in Massachusetts, and shows how important the
industry is to the town.</p>

<p>For the two seasons previous to 1907-08 every scalloper was required
to have a license. In 1905-06 the price was 50 cents, while the following
year, 1906-07, 190 licenses, costing $1 each, were taken out. No
licenses were required in 1907-08. Special by-laws, either limiting
the catch or enforcing a close season to meet the demands of the fishery,
are made by the town each year.</p>

<p>Scallops have been always plentiful, but fifty-five years ago they
were not caught, as they were considered poisonous. The present industry
started in 1883, and since that time, in spite of its ups and
downs, it has remained a constant source of revenue to the island.
Notwithstanding a scarcity of scallops, the high prices of 1905-06
enabled the fishermen to have a fairly successful season. Both the
1906-07 and the 1907-08 seasons have been very prosperous, as scallops
have been plentiful.</p>


<h3><i>New Bedford.</i></h3>

<p>The scallop industry at New Bedford has been in existence since
about 1870, and has furnished a livelihood for an average of 15 men
ever since. Of late years the industry has shown a marked decline.</p>

<p>In 1879 A. Howard Clark says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Scallops are plentiful in the Acushnet River, and large quantities are
taken with dredges from October through the winter. The business of late
years has greatly increased.</p></div>

<p>About the same time Ernest Ingersoll also writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the Acushnet River and all along the western shore of Buzzards Bay
these little mollusks abound, and their catching has come to be of considerable
importance in that locality. Mr. W. A. Wilcox, who sends me
notes on the subject, says that it is only eighteen years ago that a fisherman
of Fairhaven (opposite New Bedford) was unable to sell 5 gallons
that he had caught. But the taste has been acquired, and a local market
has grown up to important proportions, so that in 1880 14 men and 10
small boats (dories) were dredging for scallops in Buzzards Bay from
the middle of October to the middle of January. Mr. Wilcox says: "These
small boats will take from 10 to 75 bushels a day." These men are not
willing to work every day, however, since the tautog and other fishing calls
their attention, and there is danger of overstocking the market. It therefore
happens that the total catch reported for both New Bedford and
Fairhaven men will not exceed 6,400 gallons, valued at $3,864, 60 cents
being a fair price in this and the Boston market. The value of the investment
devoted to this business at Fairhaven is about $120.</p></div>

<p>The scallop industry of 1907 cannot be compared with that of former
years. The amount of scallops taken is not one-third of the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
production. More men are engaged in the business than twenty-five
years ago, but the beds are raked clean in a shorter time. The annual
yield has sadly fallen off, in spite of improved methods of capture and
increased number of fishermen. This decline cannot here be attributed
to either of the natural enemies of the scallop, as neither the starfish
nor oyster drill are abundant. Severe climatic conditions and overfishing
by man are the direct causes of this decline.</p>

<p>The scallop area of New Bedford comprises approximately 400 acres,
principally in the Acushnet River and in Clark's Cove.</p>

<p>In 1906-07, 38 licenses were issued by the city for scalloping. This
is a marked decrease over former years. Probably not all these men
fish regularly. In the last few years the season has been rather short,
lasting between three and four weeks, as the scallops were practically
all caught in that time.</p>

<p>The capital required for the business, consisting of cat boats, skiffs,
dredges, shanties, etc., amounts to about $5,600; but this is merely
transient, and is only employed for three or four weeks, and then devoted
to other fisheries.</p>

<p>All scalloping is done by dredging from either cat boats or dories.
Since 1879 improvements have been made, and cat boats instead of
dories, each manned by one man with six dredges, now do the work
once wholly performed, as Ingersoll says, by dories. All the scalloping
takes place in deep water.</p>

<p>When the law of 1905 made the Acushnet River and Clark's Cove
forbidden shellfish territory, because of the sewage pollution of the
harbor, the capture of scallops in season was still allowed. This was
based on the principle that there is no danger in eating the clean
"eye" of the scallop, although as a matter of fact there is actual
danger of typhoid infection to those handling anything from sewage-polluted
waters.</p>

<p>The following notes were made Nov. 21, 1905, upon the fishery of that
year:&mdash;</p>

<p>At the opening of the season a bed of scallops was discovered just
outside the harbor beyond the light. Twenty-five boats set to work
immediately, but there was not a sufficient supply of scallops to keep
them long employed, and one by one they dropped out, until by November
21 only two or three boats were still engaged in the fishery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>The scallops of this year were of large size, 2&frac12; to 2&frac34; inches, and
turned out a gallon of "eyes" per bushel,&mdash;an excellent yield, as the
average scallops only shuck out 2&frac12; to 3 quarts to a bushel of shells.
If a man could obtain a gallon per day by November 21 he was lucky,
and owing to the high retail price, he made a fair day's wages.</p>


<h3><i>Orleans.</i></h3>

<p>On the flats about &frac12; to 1 mile from the west shore scallops are
occasionally found. Six years ago there was a fairly good season, but
since that time there have been very few scallops, and these are taken
only for home consumption.</p>


<h3><i>Provincetown.</i></h3>

<p>Scallops are obtained on the flats in the east bend of the harbor
toward the Truro shore, where they are blown by a southwest wind.
Evidently there must be a bed of scallops in the deep water from
which the scallops are washed on the flats. In 1905-06 from 2 to 6
men were engaged in picking up these scallops and retailing them for
home trade. About 1894 or 1895 scallops were numerous, and it was
not uncommon for a man to pick up 5 bushels on the flats at one tide.
Since 1900 but few scallops have been found.</p>


<h3><i>Tisbury.</i></h3>

<p>The scalloping grounds of Tisbury are in the harbor at Vineyard
Haven. Only Vineyard Haven fishermen make a business of scalloping
here. The scallop grounds comprise an area of 800 acres.</p>

<p>Most of the scallops are obtained by dredging from cat boats, which
are nearly all equipped with power. With two exceptions the boats
are singly manned. Fourteen men go in 8 boats, using from six to
eight dredges per boat. Six men scallop in skiffs, using one dredge.
The dredges are similar to those used at Edgartown.</p>

<p>During the season of 1907-08, 3,000 gallons of scallops, valued at
$3,930 were captured. The fishermen ship chiefly to the New York
market. The scallops are of an exceptionally large size, opening, it
is said, 4 quarts to the bushel. The proportionate size of the "eye"
to the shell is much greater than with the ordinary scallop.</p>

<p>No licenses or permits are required for scalloping. The last season
(1907-08) is the second season that scallops have been abundant in this
locality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Wareham.</i></h3>

<p>Situated at the head of Buzzards Bay, the town of Wareham possesses
a considerable water area which is suitable for scallops. The
entire territory, embracing approximately 2,500 acres, extends in a
southwesterly direction from Peter's Neck, including Onset Bay, to
Abiel's Buoy and from there to Weweantit River. Scallops are also
found in the Wareham River. Scallops are mostly found in the deeper
water, which makes dredging the only profitable method of scalloping
in this locality.</p>

<p>Scalloping is practically all done by dredging either from sail or
power boats, only 3 power boats being in use during the 1907-08 season.
Three men from the village of Wareham use "pushers," but the
yield from this style of fishing is very small. The style of dredge in
most common use is the "scraper." This year the price paid for the
frame of the dredge is $3.50. These dredges have the blade set downward
firmly, and have a chain bottom of iron rings. The usual number
per boat is eight, but at Onset any number from four to fourteen are
used, according to the size of the boat and the individual choice of the
scalloper. Nearly all the boats are cat boats, averaging in value about
$300.</p>

<p>About 30 regular openers have been engaged off and on by the scallopers.
When the catch was large at the first of the season more
openers were engaged,&mdash;often as many as 3 to a scalloper. One-tenth
of the number are women.</p>

<p>The quantity of scallops taken during 1907-08 was approximately
10,000 bushels, valued at $13,100. During October the catch was about
15 bushels per day for the average scalloper, but later became considerably
less. The greater part of the scallops were sold to the New
Bedford Fish Company, the representatives of which bought them
unsoaked from the fishermen. Certain of the fishermen, however, preferred
to ship their catch to the Boston and New York markets.</p>

<p>No permits were issued in 1907-08. Previous to this year, permits
were required from every scalloper. Wareham has a fish committee,
the duty of which is to enforce the fish laws.</p>

<p>The first scalloping started in Wareham in 1879, when several boats
from New Bedford commenced dredging in Wareham waters. From
that time the industry rapidly developed, until it assumed considerable
importance as a winter occupation. Since 1899 the industry has been
practically dead until the present season of 1907-08. The Wareham
scallopers to a man attribute this decline to the inroads of the destructive
starfish. While the scallops have been so exterminated that no
profitable fishery has been conducted the last seven years, they have
not been wholly extinct, as a few could be found each year. Lately
the number has been increasing, until in 1907-08 the season was very
profitable. In connection with this it is said that the starfish were less
numerous than usual. The prospects of another good season in 1908-09
are excellent, as "seed" scallops are said to be plentiful in many places,
especially in the deep water, which furnishes protection in case of a
severe winter.</p>


<h3><i>Wellfleet.</i></h3>

<p>At the present time in Wellfleet Bay there is no commercial scallop
fishery, although scattering scallops are found in various parts of
the harbor.</p>


<h3><i>Yarmouth.</i></h3>

<p>The scallop grounds of Yarmouth are on the south side of the town,
on the flats which border the shore from Bass River to Lewis Bay.
Part of the waters of Lewis Bay belong to the town of Yarmouth,
and scallops are found over all this territory. The nature of the bottom
is the same as at Dennis and Barnstable. The total area of scallop
territory is estimated at 2,250 acres. The scallop grounds of Dennis
are open to Yarmouth scallopers.</p>

<p>Both dredges and "pushers" are employed in the scallop fishery of
the town. The method depends upon the location of the scallops,
whether in shallow or deep water, as well as the means of the individual
scallopers. Both the Chatham dredge and the "scraper" are used.
Forty-one men were engaged in the 1907-08 fishery, using 15 boats and
ten dories.</p>

<p>The production for 1907-08 was 8,000 gallons, valued at $10,480.
Scallops were shipped to New York and Boston markets.</p>

<p>The same laws as were quoted for Dennis, the two towns having
common fishery rights.</p>

<p>The 1904-05 season was prosperous, as Yarmouth scallopers had the
privilege of scalloping in the large bed off Dennis. The two following
years were very poor, and even the last season has not been up to the
average.</p>

<h2><a name="Oyster_Ostrea_Virginiana" id="Oyster_Ostrea_Virginiana"><span class="smcap">Oyster</span> (<i>Ostrea Virginiana</i>).</a></h2>


<h3><i>Introduction.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Resolves of 1905, Chapter 73.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the commissioners on fisheries and game are hereby
authorized and directed to make a biological investigation and report as
to the best methods, conditions and localities for the propagation of oysters
under the conditions found in Massachusetts waters. The commissioners
may expend for the purposes of this resolve a sum not exceeding five hundred
dollars a year for a period of three years.</p></div>

<p>As authorized by the above act, the Commissioners on Fisheries and
Game have conducted experiments of a biological nature upon the
oyster. At the start of the investigations, for a proper understanding
of the various conditions in the different localities, it was necessary to
make a survey of the oyster industry of the State. Recently this survey
has been supplemented by sending printed questions to the oystermen,
and the whole put in the form of a report, which gives an account of
the industry. This first report on the oyster is merely a broad survey
of the whole industry of the State, and is preliminary to future reports
of a more scientific character.</p>

<p><i>The Need of a Survey.</i>&mdash;In 1879 Mr. Ernest Ingersoll, in his "Monograph
on the Oyster,"<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> gave an excellent account of the oyster industry
of Massachusetts. Since that time no complete account, either statistical
or biological, has been written. Meanwhile, the oyster industry
of the State, owing to its steady improvement, has changed in the past
twenty-eight years, and what was true of 1879 is not true of 1907.
Not only have localities changed and new areas been opened up, but
also the whole industry has expanded through the enterprise and business
ability of the oystermen, and to-day Massachusetts possesses an
oyster fishery which more than doubles the production of 1879. Thus
a survey of this fishery, by comparison with that of 1879, shows the
changes that have taken place, and gives some idea of the growth of
the industry.</p>

<p>It is hoped that this report will furnish sufficient data to give actual
knowledge of the conditions of oyster culture in the State, show the
success of this industry, and indicate what is essential for its future
improvement. It is necessary, in view of the conflict between the quahaug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
and oyster fisheries, that the public understand the exact situation,
and this is possible only through a published account of each industry.</p>

<p><i>Scope of the Report.</i>&mdash;The object of the report is to furnish information
which will be of value both to the oysterman and to the consumer.
Primarily the report is for the oysterman, showing the extent of
the industry in his own locality and in other parts of the coast, where
perhaps he is unacquainted with the conditions. While exact facts are
presented for the benefit of the oysterman, this report at the same time
tries to give a general description of the industry for the consumer, who
perhaps knows nothing of the oyster except as an article of food.</p>

<p>The first part of the report has been arranged under the following
headings: (1) the natural oyster beds; (2) results of the survey; (3)
history of the industry; (4) the oyster laws; (5) the oyster industry;
(6) general statistics. The second part considers separately the industry
of each town or section.</p>

<p><i>Methods of Work.</i>&mdash;The statistical figures for the oyster industry
are reasonably complete as the oyster fishery is on a more systematic
business basis than any of the other shellfisheries. Nevertheless, on certain
points it was impossible to obtain absolutely correct information, as,
for instance, the area of grants, since no survey is made of the grants
when leased, and the oysterman himself does not know the exact area of
his granted territory. Thus an estimate has to be made by each oysterman
of his granted area, and, while this is approximately correct, it
cannot be considered as absolutely true.</p>

<p>The statistical returns were compiled by sending to each oysterman
in the State a blank form, containing a series of questions, with the
request that he would co-operate with the commission by answering.
Many oystermen responded with complete answers, thus permitting the
commission, through their aid, to publish an extended report on the
oyster fishery. However, it was found impossible to obtain complete
information from several towns, as a number of oystermen neglected
to return these blanks. The return of each oysterman is filed at the
office of the Commission on Fisheries and Game, and only the total
for each town is published, thus treating as confidential the private
business of individuals. The commission expresses a most cordial
acknowledgment to the oystermen for their co-operation in this matter.</p>

<p>The other parts of the report were obtained by personal inspection
of the oyster beds as to their biological conditions, by means of town
records, and interviews with the oystermen. Town records, which
should have given the location, number and areas of the grants, proved
nearly worthless in most cases, owing to incompleteness, loss and confusion.
Owing to the frequent change in selectmen, little if any information
could be obtained from this source, as the new selectmen were
generally unacquainted with the work of their predecessors concerning
the leasing of oyster grants. The grants were often incompletely described,
bounds uncertain and the acreage unknown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>The interviews with the individual oystermen furnished more and
better information both in regard to the present condition of the industry
and the general history for each town.</p>

<p>Personal inspection of the oyster grounds was made, the biological
conditions noted and the area of the grants plotted on the accompanying
maps. Not all these grants are worked, and parts of the cultivated
grants are unfit for oyster raising. The charted area includes all
grants, cultivated or uncultivated.</p>

<p>In reviewing the history of the industry, information was obtained
from town records, oystermen who had been in the business for years,
and various newspapers and periodicals. For a comparison of the
oyster industry of 1879 and 1907 the excellent report of Mr. Ernest
Ingersoll upon the "Oyster Industry," published in the tenth census
of the United States, was used for comparison, and in many places
directly quoted. Were it not for this work and the report of A. Howard
Clark on the "Fisheries of Massachusetts," it would have been impossible
to draw any reliable comparison with the oyster industry of
twenty-eight years ago.</p>

<p><i>Massachusetts as an Oyster State.</i>&mdash;Massachusetts is perhaps not so
well adapted for oyster culture as it is for clam or quahaug farming,
and does not equal other seacoast States in the extent of its oyster
industry. Nevertheless, the oyster industry is on a much firmer footing
than the other shellfisheries, and is an important adjunct to the wealth
of the southern Massachusetts towns.</p>

<p>All the oyster grants, except in the towns of Wellfleet, Eastham and
Orleans, are found south of Cape Cod, as the southern shore of Massachusetts
alone is adapted for the oyster industry. Along the south side
of Cape Cod and in Buzzards Bay the numerous inlets and estuaries
afford with their brackish water excellent ground for the cultivation of
this bivalve, and many acres which otherwise would be barren have been
made productive through the grant system; while the shores of Massachusetts
which adjoin the waters of Narragansett Bay possess, in the
Taunton, Cole and Lee's rivers, excellent waters for the growth of seed
oysters. Thus Massachusetts possesses good facilities for oyster culture,
which are capable of a far greater expansion than present conditions
indicate.</p>

<p>However well developed the oyster industry is at present, there is
plenty of room for improvement. It is the consensus of opinion among
the oystermen that the business is developing every year,&mdash;a fact
that speaks well for its future. Improvements in the oyster industry
can arise in three ways: (1) investment of more capital in the business,
which will allow more extensive operations; (2) more intensive cultivation
of the present grounds; (3) the opening of new areas for oyster
culture and the utilization of waters at present useless. Everything
indicates that the oyster industry will take advantage of opportunities
as soon as they are given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Oyster Grant System.</i>&mdash;Oyster culture in Massachusetts is the
logical result of the failure of the natural oyster beds. When these
beds became destitute of oysters through overfishing, it was necessary
that means should be used to perpetuate the stock. Oyster planting
had been successfully carried on in the States south of Massachusetts,
and it was merely a question of experiment whether the oyster would
respond to the same methods in Massachusetts. Thus oyster culture
arose in this State at first as an experiment, later as an established
industry. Grants were given, as through this way only could oyster
planting become a success, and the "free fishery" people were forced
to bow to public opinion, which decreed that grants should be leased.
Thus oyster grants arose from necessity, as in no other way could
Massachusetts preserve her oyster supply.</p>

<p>The system of oyster grants and oyster culture, in spite of its many
failings, has shown what can be done to preserve and increase a natural
shellfish industry if the proper methods are used. Planted beds have
furnished enough spawn to maintain the natural beds, which would
have long ago been depleted through the inroads of overfishing. They
have preserved a fishery which would have disappeared almost completely,
and established a better and more extensive industry, not only
benefiting the oystermen, but also those indirectly associated with the
business, such as teamsters, transportation companies, etc.</p>

<p>In the following report various abuses of the present system of
oyster culture will be enumerated, and it is only necessary to state
that many evils must be eliminated before the oyster industry can
obtain its maximum expansion. Such evils as town politics, disputes
with quahaugers, etc., will have to be remedied. The greatest obstacle
which now checks the oyster industry is the <i>lack of protection</i>. Until
complete protection is given to the oysterman, the industry will never
attain to its full development. The removal of the abuses by the organization
of the oyster industry of the State under a unified system
is the best way to secure proper regulation and improvement of the
oyster industry.</p>


<h3><i>The Natural Oyster Beds.</i></h3>

<p>While there has been much discussion whether oysters were ever
native in Massachusetts Bay, or merely the result of southern "plants,"
the consensus of opinion is that there were natural oyster beds in
existence when the first settlers came to this coast. Not only do historical
records show this, but the remains of the natural beds at the
present time indicate that oysters have existed for centuries. Thus
there seems to be no reasonable doubt that the northern coast of Massachusetts,
as well as the southern, once possessed extensive natural oyster
beds.</p>

<p>I. <i>Location of the Natural Oyster Beds.</i>&mdash;(1) <i>Parker River.</i>&mdash;A
natural bed of oysters once existed in the Parker River at Newbury,
and even fifty years ago it is said that oysters could still be obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
from this natural bed. About 1882 the experiment of fattening oysters
for market was made, and many bushels were bedded on the flats during
the summer by an oyster firm at Newbury. These oysters not only
grew well, but threw considerable spawn, furnishing a good set in the
river. Oyster raising was then tried, but the result was a failure, as
the oysters which were planted in too shallow water were killed during
the winter.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Mystic and Charles Rivers.</i>&mdash;Mr. Ernest Ingersoll states that:
"In 1634 William Wood, in his 'New England's Prospect,' speaks of
'a great oyster bank' in Charles River, and another in the 'Mysticke,'
each of which obstructed the navigation of its river." He locates the
Charles River beds as either off Cambridgeport or near the site of the
Boston Museum of Natural History.</p>

<p>Dr. G. W. Field, chairman of this department, in his report in 1902
as biologist to the Charles River Dam Commission, makes the following
statement about the Charles River oyster:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The oyster (<i>Ostrea</i>), formerly abundant, is no longer living, and, from
what indications I have been able to gather, probably became extinct
within twenty-five years. Their dead shells are brought up by dredging
operations. Their peculiar elongated shape is the result of growth being
concentrated at the upper end, as a result of their closely crowded position
in the bed, or of an attempt to keep the opening above the accumulating
mud, and thus avoid being smothered. The fact that there are few signs of
small "seed oysters" tends to prove that the bottom was so muddy that
they found few places to "set." From the elongated shape of the shells
may be inferred that the amount of sedimentation going on in that particular
region was rapid during the life of the group of oysters whose shells are
to be found in quantities in the material dredged between Harvard and
Brookline bridges. This sediment need not necessarily have been sand or
clay, or any material which is persistent, but it might have been flocculent
organic d&eacute;bris, which remained but a short time and left little or no evidence,
beyond its effect upon the shape of the oyster shells.</p></div>

<p>In the above account Dr. Field not only locates the original oyster
beds of Charles River, but also furnishes evidence which indicates the
cause of their extinction, <i>i.e.</i>, the d&eacute;bris and sewage, or waste poisonous,
polluting materials, of a large city emptying into the river. This is not
only true of the Charles, but also of the Mystic and Taunton river beds,
which have been destroyed in like manner.</p>

<p>(3) Mr. Ernest Ingersoll, in his report on the "Oyster Industry of
the United States," in 1880 mentions that natural oyster beds were once
at Weymouth, Ipswich, Barnstable and Rowley. Nothing further can
be learned concerning these places.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Wellfleet.</i>&mdash;An extensive oyster bed was found at Wellfleet Bay,
which not only furnished a sufficient supply for the first settlers, but
enabled the inhabitants of Wellfleet to carry on a considerable trade by
shipping them to Boston and other ports, until it was finally destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
in 1775. Its destruction was due to overfishing and the utilization of
the shells for lime, which soon destroyed the natural bar.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Chatham.</i>&mdash;A natural oyster bed once existed in the Oyster
Pond, but no trace of it now remains.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Harwich.</i>&mdash;Herring River in the town of Harwich still possesses
the remnants of a natural oyster bed, as occasionally a few
oysters can be gathered along its banks. This bed once comprised a
stretch of three-quarters of a mile along the river.</p>

<p>(7) <i>Yarmouth.</i>&mdash;The town of Yarmouth once possessed a natural
oyster bed in Mill Creek, but this was fished out by 1895 and then
granted for oyster culture.</p>

<p>(8) <i>Barnstable.</i>&mdash;There is a natural oyster bed at Centerville.</p>

<p>(9) <i>Martha's Vineyard.</i>&mdash;Native oysters are said to have existed in
the brackish ponds on the south side of the island; a few are found
there at the present time.</p>

<p>(10) <i>Falmouth.</i>&mdash;A few native oysters are to be found in the salt
ponds on the south coast of the town. In Squeteague Pond and Wild
Harbor oysters were once native.</p>

<p>Buzzards Bay comprises the best natural oyster territory in the
State. At the present time the natural oyster industry has been supplanted
by oyster culture, which gradually took the place of the declining
natural oyster fishery. While natural beds still exist to some
extent, they are, to all practical purposes, extinct. Where once there
were extensive areas, now there are only scattering oysters. In many
cases the beds have been so completely destroyed that the ground has
been granted for oyster culture. That Buzzards Bay is a "natural set
area" can be readily seen by the amount of "seed oysters" that are
caught by the oystermen who plant shells for the purpose.</p>

<p>(11) <i>Bourne.</i>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) <i>Red Brook Harbor.</i>&mdash;In 1879 Ernest Ingersoll
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the southern shore of this harbor, about a mile from its head, exists
a living bed of natural oysters some 7 acres in extent, under the protection
of the town for public benefit. The oysters growing on it are reported to
be large, but not of extraordinary size, scalloped and roundish, differing in
no respect from aged oysters grown after transplanting to another part of
the bay.</p></div>

<p>In 1907 this natural bed had been reduced to 3 acres, and the unproductive
part granted.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Barlow River.</i>&mdash;In 1873 an act was passed to protect the oyster
fishery in Barlow River, by ordering a closed season of one and one-half
years. The passage of this act shows that a natural bed of importance
existed in this river, and that even in 1873 the effects of overfishing
were apparent. At the present time there are but few native
oysters in Barlow River, or, as it is sometimes called, Pocasset River.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Monument River.</i>&mdash;A natural bed also existed in Monument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
River, which became so depleted that about 1875 the river was surveyed
and divided into small grants.</p>

<p>(12) <i>Wareham.</i>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) <i>Wareham River.</i>&mdash;Natural oysters are found
in the Wareham or Agawam River, which has been one of the most
productive natural beds in the State, and still furnishes a scant living
for two or three men. In view of the overfishing, it is surprising that
any of the natural oysters have survived, except on reserved areas of
the town, which are opened every three or seven years for the capture
of "seed."</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Weweantit River.</i>&mdash;The Weweantit River, which lies between
the towns of Wareham and Marion, has a larger and better natural
oyster bed than the Wareham River, but this has also been depleted by
overfishing, except on the reserved areas of the town of Wareham.</p>

<p>(13) <i>Dartmouth.</i>&mdash;A few oysters are found in Slocum's River.</p>

<p>(14) <i>Westport.</i>&mdash;Westport River has also a few oysters.</p>

<p>(15) <i>Taunton River, Coles River and Lee's River.</i>&mdash;These rivers
once had extensive beds of natural oysters, but now are wholly devoted
to growing oysters. Old records and laws show how important these
natural beds were, and also furnish an excellent illustration of the
effects of overfishing combined with water pollution from manufacturing
sources.</p>

<p>II. <i>Decline of the Natural Oyster Beds.</i>&mdash;The above-mentioned
examples furnish abundant proof that the natural oyster beds of the
State, which once were sufficient to supply the wants of our forefathers,
have declined to such an extent that at the present time but few
natural oysters are tonged for the market. Where there were formerly
many acres of excellent native oysters, to-day there is scarcely an acre
that can be called good oyster fishing, except in a few cases where the
towns maintain a nearly perpetual closed season. No proof of the
decline is necessary; it is an established fact.</p>

<p>There have been two principal causes which have ruined the natural
oyster beds; besides these two,&mdash;(1) water pollution and (2) overfishing,&mdash;certain
geographical changes have doubtless occurred, which
have accelerated the decline.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Water Pollution.</i>&mdash;The effect of water pollution through the
sediment deposited by sewage and manufacturing waste on the natural
oyster beds is well illustrated by the destruction of the Charles River
beds. This is also shown in a less degree in the Taunton River.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Overfishing.</i>&mdash;The primary cause of the decline of the natural
oyster beds was overfishing. This is particularly true of the beds
south of Cape Cod and in Buzzards Bay, which were of large extent,
and unpolluted by manufacturing wastes or sewage. This overfishing
has not been the result of the last few years, since records show that
as early as 1824 Harwich passed an act to preserve the oyster fishery
of the town; and that Sandwich, in the part which is now the town
of Bourne, in 1832 passed regulations protecting the natural oyster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
fishery in Monument River; while at Wellfleet the natural oyster bed
was completely exterminated by the year 1775. Overfishing has affected
the natural beds in several ways, all of which have worked toward the
general decline of the native oyster.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The first settlers took the large oysters from the natural beds,
which under normal conditions had all they could do to keep up the
supply. In this way the beds were deprived of the spawning oysters,
with the result that in spite of the closed seasons, which gave little if
any benefit, a gradual decline set in.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) At the same time that the oysters were being taken from the
beds, the early oystermen through ignorance were making an economic
blunder by not returning the shells to the waters. The oyster shells
furnish naturally the best surfaces for the collection of "seed," as
spat will set only on clean surfaces. By taking the large oysters and
with them the shells and other d&eacute;bris from the bed, the natural oyster
bars were destroyed and less space given for the spat to catch. So
both the taking of the large oysters in excessive amounts and the destruction
of the natural spat collectors, either for lime, as was done at
Wellfleet, or for other purposes, were sufficient in the early days to
cause the decline of the natural oyster beds.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) In more recent times the destruction of the natural beds has
been hastened by the taking of the small oysters. This practice was due
to two reasons: (1) the supply of large oysters was exhausted; (2)
oyster culture became important, and the natural beds were raked clean
for "seed" which the oystermen obtained for planting on their grants.
Thus the oyster grant system has been the chief cause of the destruction
of the natural beds in the last forty years. It was only when the
natural beds failed that grants were given, and so oyster culture cannot
be considered the primary cause of the destruction of the natural
beds, but only a later agency in their total extermination. The natural
beds in Buzzards Bay all bear testimony to these three means of overfishing,
and in recent years particularly to the last.</p>

<p>It has been a most fortunate thing for Massachusetts that the oyster
grant system was inaugurated as soon as the decline of the natural
fishery became manifest, else at the present time there would be no
oysters in the State, for it is recognized that the present natural beds
are perpetuated by the spawn which comes from the various oyster
grants. Foresight has indeed provided an excellent oyster industry,
which is rapidly improving. It is only necessary to apply similar
methods of culture to the other shellfish industries of the State to insure
their future also; otherwise the decline, which is following the same
steps as the destruction of the natural oyster beds, will lead to the commercial
extinction of these valuable fisheries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Results of the Survey.</i></h3>

<p>The survey of the oyster industry has shown several interesting facts
which should be brought to the attention of the fishermen and consumers.
In the first place, it has shown that the oyster fishery is a
larger and more important industry than it has been commonly considered,
and that the welfare of the shore fisheries of southern Massachusetts
depends upon its maintenance. Secondly, the oyster industry
is to-day in a position where it cannot reach its full development for
the reason merely that the present laws do not encourage the expansion
of the industry. Thirdly, the oyster industry is trammeled by certain
abuses, chiefly of a legal nature, which hinder its development, and upon
the abolition of which depends its future success. Fourthly, the oyster
industry under present conditions encroaches to some extent upon the
other shellfish rights, especially in relation to the quahaug fishery, and
has caused much jealous feeling; but if properly regulated there should
be room for both industries.</p>

<p>In order to obtain the opinion of the oystermen concerning the
present abuses of the oyster industry, and how these could be best
remedied, the following question was asked of the individual planters:
"What measures or laws would, in your opinion, be best adapted for
the improvement of the oyster industry?" Although many neglected
to answer this question, forty-three opinions were offered, dealing with
the problems which the oystermen consider as needing attention and
upon which the welfare of the industry depends. These answers have
been arranged in tabular form, showing the number of oystermen who
advocate certain measures.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Measures suggested.</span>

</table>

<p>While these answers show a diversity of ideas, about 75 per cent. urge
that something be done to improve the present system, and, while many
are in favor of placing the industry under State control, the majority is
definitely of the opinion that the present system of town control is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
proving a serious drawback to the oyster industry. The best interests
of the oysterman and the consumer demand a better method of regulation
of this industry. As long as town politics, partiality and carelessness
enter into the leasing of oyster grants, and thus deprive certain
people of their rights, it is safe to say that the oyster industry can
never get beyond its present state of development. One solution of the
difficulty might be full State control of leasing the grounds for the
oyster industry. This is possibly too radical a step at present, and
the system can perhaps be so adjusted as to remedy its defects without
taking the control of the fishery entirely away from the hands of the
town. Another solution is to continue the system of town control, but
to have a State commission which would act as a board of appeal for
all who felt aggrieved at the judgment of the selectmen.</p>

<p>The advisability of ten-year grants has caused much comment among
the oystermen. Practically all grants are now given for this period
of time. As a system it is deservedly unpopular, since it does not help
the quahaug interest, and it checks the development of the oyster industry.
The oyster business, unlike the other branches of shellfish
culture, requires a considerable capital. This system of ten-year grants
operates directly to discourage the outlay of capital. If the oysterman
were sure of reaping the benefits of his labor and capital, it would be
to his selfish interest to develop his own grant to its maximum capacity.
But what far-sighted business man will invest money in a business
which stands a good chance of being completely "wiped out" in a
few years? Again, this system makes three years out of the ten practically
worthless. The oysterman usually "seeds" his grant about three
years before he expects to reap his harvest; but when his grant has
run for seven years, it is evident that he will plant no more oysters
because of the uncertainty of obtaining a second lease, and naturally
does not desire to invest his labor and money for the benefit of an
unknown successor.</p>

<p>The remedy for this is not difficult. If a grant were rented annually
as long as the planter desired to hold it, to be forfeited if not improved
to a certain standard (to be decided upon), or for non-payment of
rent, the difficulties above enumerated would disappear. Much of the
territory now held unimproved would either be brought up to a standard
of excellence or given over to the quahaugers, and in either case direct
benefits would result. If legislation were so arranged that any man
might take, by the payment of a nominal rent, a small piece of ground,
which he could hold as long as he improved it, the oyster industry could
be put on a firmer footing; a man confident of enjoying the fruits of
his labors could thus improve his grant, and, as he acquired skill and
knowledge, could add other land and ultimately expect to build up a
successful business.</p>

<p>A third important suggestion relates to the marketing of oysters in
a sanitary condition. The oyster industry of the State has suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
severely because of the scare resulting from the marketing of oysters
from contaminated waters. The Cape and Buzzards Bay oysters are
in general free from all sewage contamination, and should not be considered
on the same basis as the impure varieties from outside the State.
Naturally, the Massachusetts oystermen desire that there be some guarantee
for the purity of the oysters marketed, as their interests suffer
because this impure stock is often sold under the name of the Cape
oyster. If laws were passed requiring the inspection and certification
of marketed oysters in regard to healthful conditions under which they
have been produced, both the oyster planter and the consumer would
be benefited.</p>

<p>There is but little doubt that the oyster industry can be still further
developed by opening waste territory which at this time does not appear
available, since under existing conditions proper capital cannot
be induced to enter the business. The oyster industry demands more
attention than it has hitherto received, and must be considered an important
asset of the Commonwealth.</p>


<h3><i>History of the Industry.</i></h3>

<p>Although the oyster laws are the mile-stones which mark the progress
of the oyster industry, and any consideration of the development
of these laws naturally gives many historical features, it is nevertheless
necessary, at the risk of repetition, to give a separate account
of the history of the oyster fishery. The Massachusetts oyster fishery
can be divided historically into three distinct periods: (1) the free
fishing period; (2) the period of bedding southern oysters; (3) the
period of oyster grants.</p>

<p>(1) <i>The Free Native Fishery (1620-1840).</i>&mdash;In the early colonial
days the oyster fishery was considered in the same way as the other
shellfisheries are now looked upon, <i>i.e.</i>, held to be the common property
of the inhabitants of the Commonwealth. The natural supply was abundant
enough to meet the needs of all the inhabitants, and for many
years no signs of decline were manifest. In 1775 the natural beds of
Wellfleet gave out, furnishing the first record of unmistakable decline.
From that time there arose an extensive series of protective laws, with
the one object of preserving the natural supply by limiting the demand.
This policy of protective laws, though perhaps temporarily beneficial,
was based on an erroneous principle. It was preventive, but not constructive,
and did not build up the demolished fishery.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Oyster Bedding (1840-70).</i>&mdash;With the decline of the natural
beds, the practice of bedding southern "plants" became an important
part of the oyster trade. The southern oysters were bedded on the
flats in the spring and taken up for market in the fall. Salem, Wellfleet
and Boston were the leading places in this new phase of the oyster
industry, and many thousand bushels were annually planted.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Oyster Grants (1870-1908).</i>&mdash;So successful was this summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
bedding of southern oysters that experiments were soon made in rearing
oysters. This proved successful from the start, and within a few years
the extensive grant system which is now in vogue was inaugurated on
Cape Cod and Buzzards Bay.</p>

<p>These three methods, although separated by definite periods in which
each have been the leaders, remain to a greater or less extent at the
present day. The natural beds are still in existence, and, as at Wareham,
are opened once in three or seven years, according to the discretion
of the selectmen, for catching "seed." The summer bedding of
oysters still continues, as certain planters find it more profitable to
fatten than to grow oysters, and the oyster grant system is now in full
operation.</p>

<p>A comparison of the industry of 1907 with that of 1879 shows several
changes. These changes are for the most part improvements which
have arisen with the development of the industry. In some cases the
changes have been detrimental, and a few localities have shown a decline.
New fields have opened to the oysterman both in new localities
and through the extension of the present beds. On the whole, there
has been a great increase in the grant system of oyster culture, while
the "bedding" of southern "plants," which in 1879 employed many
men, boats and extensive capital, has practically disappeared. The
annual production has increased gradually, and for 1906-07 is approximately
five times as large as in 1879. The following figures, except
for 1907, are taken from the United States Fish Commission's reports,
and show the gradual increase in production:&mdash;</p>

<h3><i>The Oyster Laws.</i></h3>

<p>In submitting a complete report upon the oyster industry, the oyster
laws, which have played an important part in the development of the
fishery, cannot be totally neglected. However, so important a subject
demands separate investigation, and offers excellent opportunities for
legal research. Therefore it is not the purpose of this report to give
more than a brief account of the present oyster laws and their history.</p>

<p>The shellfish laws of Massachusetts constitute the foundation of the
oyster industry, as they have taken a practically extinct native fishery
and have built up the present extensive business. So closely are they
connected with its welfare that the future of this growing industry
depends upon the proper expansion of these laws to meet the new
conditions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>
<p>A survey of these oyster laws, with an analysis of their merits and
defects, is needed. Their defects have brought about the present unsatisfactory
situation in certain localities, and should be remedied.
Their merits should be strengthened and amplified, as the basis of
future expansion. They have come into being from time to time, in
response to the immediate need of the hour; consequently they have
no unity, and are, indeed, but imperfectly understood. An insight
into their perplexing details should bring out many inconsistencies.
Again, no comprehensive knowledge of the history of the industry is
possible without a study of the laws. The errors once committed need
not be repeated to further embarrass the industry, and the lessons
learned by experience would be well applied to its future development.</p>

<p><i>Protective and Constructive Laws.</i>&mdash;The oyster laws can be divided
into two classes: (1) protective; and (2) constructive. The early
laws, which were passed to save the natural supply, were of the first
class; while the laws establishing the present system of oyster culture
come under the second heading. The beginnings of all legislative enactment
arose in the treatment of the natural oyster beds. These beds
were fast becoming exhausted, when laws were passed to protect their
important natural resources. This measure was only partially successful.
It did succeed in preserving the remnant of those old beds from
destruction, but it was powerless to build up an industry of any extent.
When it became clearly evident that no possible fostering of native
resources could supply the growing demands of the market, legislation
quite logically directed itself toward the artificial propagation of oysters.
From this step arose a series of problems which long proved baffling,
and still engross a great deal of public attention. The artificial propagation
of oysters necessitated the leasing of grants in tidal waters.
This giving up of public property to private individuals aroused the
opposition of rival shellfish industries, who saw in this measure a curtailment
of their resources. Numerous other difficulties of minor significance
arose from time to time, all demanding attention at the hands
of the Legislature.</p>

<p>Apart from the general supervision of the oyster industry, there
have been two other sources of legislative enactment. First, special
laws have been called for to regulate the fishery in certain waters under
the oversight of the State Board of Health. Secondly, during the past
few years the attention of the Legislature has been directed towards
the development of the oyster fishery as an important asset of the
Commonwealth, and laws authorizing various experiments, both scientific
and practical, have been passed in order to devise methods of increasing
and developing the industry.</p>

<p>I. <i>Protective Laws.</i>&mdash;The history of the oyster laws of Massachusetts
is a history of the industry itself. The rise and decline of the
fishery are distinctly traceable in the development of the legal machinery
which regulates it. From the time of the Pilgrims the oyster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
beds of the coast had been regarded as inexhaustible mines. The fallacy
of this view gradually became apparent, as these beds began to be
depleted through overfishing. As early as 1796 a general law, entitled
"An act to prevent the destruction of oysters and other shellfish," was
passed by the Legislature. Prior to 1869 the town of Harwich adopted
this old law. Shortly after, Swansea followed suit, and restricted the
exploitation of her native oyster beds in the Lee and Cole rivers. In
1870 Wellfleet inaugurated an innovation, in the nature of a permit
to take oysters, which was required of all citizens of the town. The
idea of this permit was to regulate the fishery, centralize control in
the hands of the selectmen and add to the income of the town. In
1873 Sandwich passed a law enforcing a close season on all her native
beds, to last for a period of one year. In 1875 Brewster followed
the lead of Wellfleet, in demanding permits of all outsiders and also
from all citizens taking more than 3 bushels at any one time, although
an unlimited amount might be taken for food.</p>

<p>The aim of all this legislation was not to develop the industry directly,
but indirectly by preserving and fostering the native beds. This
theory, while excellent in motive, did not work out well, as the native
beds could not by any possible protection be brought to produce an
annual yield at all adequate to the growing demands of the market.</p>

<p>The utilization of purely natural resources proving unequal to the
demands of the occasion, the creation of other resources became necessary,
and an entirely new epoch in the history of the oyster fishery
was inaugurated. This epoch marked the beginning of the production
of oysters by artificial means, and the establishment of this new industry
and the perplexing complications which grew out of it have been
the source of legislative strife for many years.</p>

<p>II. <i>Constructive Laws.</i>&mdash;The first legislation authorizing the present
system of oyster culture was instituted at Swansea, in 1869. This
was the beginning and the foundation of a broad movement of oyster
culture which spread rapidly along the southern coast of the State.
This curious law allowed the selectmen to sell, by public or private
sale, the oyster privilege of Swansea outright to any person or persons
who were citizens of the town. The measure, although apparently
designed to restrict the exhaustion of the native resources, did not
tend to develop the industry. It possessed one element of value, i.e.,
it increased the revenue of the town. Apart from its interest as the
forerunner of artificial propagation of oysters, this old law is noteworthy,
as it forms the basis of the system which to-day regulates the
industry in that section of the country. The custom of selling an
extensive oyster privilege, as apart from the system of leasing grants,
first clearly outlined in the law of 1869, still holds throughout this section.
It remains the usual custom to sell either the whole of a township's
available oyster territory, or else an extensive part of it, to one
man for a lump sum per year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1874 an important step occurred in the evolution of the oyster
industry. Swansea and Somerset were given the privilege of granting
any of their bays, shores, banks and creeks for the propagation of
oysters. This act was far more sweeping and advanced than any of
its predecessors, but it was in one respect too sweeping. It interfered
with the rights of the property owners along the shore, and was therefore
contrary to the general underlying principle of the State law,
which allows the cultivation of oysters only in so far as such cultivation
does not interfere with the vested rights of all citizens alike. The
measure proved untenable, and was promptly repealed. Its repeal
was on general principles a thing to be desired, but nevertheless a blow
to the industry. The tidal waters along the coast have always been
the most valuable part of the oyster territory, as they have proved
to be the best adapted for obtaining "oyster set." This measure was
therefore designed to aid the oyster growers, and give them valuable
privileges which belonged originally to the adjoining property owners.
Even to the present day the dividing line between the rights of property
owners and oystermen has remained an unsettled question.</p>

<p>It was about this time that the close season proved a failure in
Buzzards Bay, and the towns of Wareham, Bourne and Marion turned
their attention toward the establishment of an oyster industry. This
attempt became a settled policy of these towns about 1875.</p>

<p>In 1878 a peculiar act was passed, making it unlawful for any person
to remove oysters from any grant, even his own, between the hours
of sunset and sunrise. This act was necessary for the protection of the
oyster planters, by preventing the stealing of oysters from the grant
at night. Various efforts had been made to protect grants from such
attacks, but the extreme difficulty of detection was always an insuperable
obstacle to proper enforcement, and it was deemed expedient to
prohibit all fishing at night. That this problem had become an important
one is shown by the title of the law, which was styled "An
act for the better protection of the oyster fisheries in this commonwealth."</p>

<p>In 1884 an important act was passed, enlarging the limits of that
territory which might lawfully be used for the cultivation of oysters.
Practically all communal waters outside the jurisdiction of adjacent
land owners was thrown open for oyster grants.</p>

<p>In 1885 the institution of a public hearing was inaugurated. This
was a concession to the hostile quahaug element, and allowed the public
the opportunity of protesting against the granting of territory for
oyster culture; nevertheless, the final power really remained in the hands
of the selectmen. A further concession to this element was the law
which called for the revoking of grants within two years if unimproved.
The interests of the oystermen were also kept in sight, and legislation
passed which was designed to protect grants still more from the depredations
of outsiders. Provision was likewise made for the proper enforcement
of these laws, and the penalties attached were increased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1886 an act was passed which was designed to do away with all
possible outside monopoly. The danger of organized capital acquiring
control of a large tract and excluding small individual planters had
become apparent, and this means was taken to guard against it. The
act prohibited the transfer of grants in any township to any person
not a citizen of that township; thus, if any monopoly did exist it would
be restricted to only one township. The limits during which fishing
on grants might be carried on was lengthened two hours, so that it read
from "one hour before sunrise to one hour after sunset."</p>

<p>In 1892 the town of Yarmouth obtained a law requiring a permit
for citizens to take oysters from native beds, not exceeding 2 bushels
per week, from September 1 to June 1. This is now the only town in
the Commonwealth to require such a permit from citizens.</p>

<p>In 1895 legislation was passed relative to the proper definition of
the boundaries of grants. This was rendered necessary because of the
haphazard methods hitherto pursued in giving grants with very indefinite
boundaries. Mean low-water mark was fixed as the shoreward
boundary of grants, while mean high-water mark was defined as the
limit to which shells might be placed to catch the set. This, however,
was dependent upon the owners of the adjacent property, and their
consent was held necessary before this territory between high and low
water could thus be utilized.</p>

<p>In 1901 special legislation was passed, restricting the catching of
oysters in contaminated waters except for bait.</p>

<p>In 1904 authority was granted to proper officials to develop the
oyster industry by planting shellfish, or by close season.</p>

<p>In 1905 the Fish and Game Commission was authorized to expend
a sum not exceeding $500 per annum for the investigation of the oyster,
by experiment or otherwise, with a view to developing the industry.</p>

<p>The development of the oyster laws has been by a process of evolution.
They have kept pace with the growth of the industry, and have
been in fact the logical outcome of that expansion. The various acts
which go to make up the bulk of this legislation have been passed from
time to time to fill the immediate demands of the hour, and consequently
lack that unity and consistency which might otherwise characterize
them. Changing conditions have called for alterations in the legal
machinery, as the industry has expanded, to meet new requirements.
These additions have frequently been dictated by short-sighted policy,
and the Commonwealth as a whole has often been lost sight of in the
welfare of the community.</p>

<p>Of all the shellfisheries, the oyster industry is most hampered by
unwise legislation. It is the most difficult to handle, because it presents
many perplexing phases from which the others are free. Clams, quahaugs
and scallops flourish in their respective territories, and legislation
merely tends to regulate their exploitation or marketing. With the
oyster, however, other problems have arisen. The areas in the State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
where oysters grow naturally are few in number and relatively of small
importance. The clam, quahaug and scallop grounds are to be compared
with wild pastures and meadows, which yield their harvests without
cultivation; while the oyster grants are gardens, which must be
planted and carefully tended.</p>

<p>With this distinction arises another question, of far-reaching significance,&mdash;the
question of private ownership. The quahaug, clam and
scallop fisheries demand that the tidal flats and waters be held in common
as communal interests, and freely open to all citizens of the town;
the oyster fishery requires that certain portions of these flats and waters
be set aside for private ownership. With the economic questions involved
in this discussion it is not the purpose of this report to deal.
There is one fact, in any case, which cannot be argued away. The
oyster industry is dependent solely upon private ownership of grants.
If, therefore, the oyster industry is to be encouraged at all,&mdash;and it
certainly has very great possibilities,&mdash;this fact of private ownership
must be accepted at once. If, as some assert, it is an evil, it is a necessary
evil, and it has come to stay. The questions remaining for legislation
on this subject are the proper regulation of this private ownership,
so as to give the maximum of encouragement to the oyster fishery, and
the minimum of danger to the rival shellfish industries.</p>

<p>The oyster and quahaug industries openly clash. This is an unfortunate
occurrence, but it cannot be avoided, since the ground suitable
for the culture of oysters is almost always the natural home of the
quahaug. Therefore, when portions of this ground are given out to
private individuals for the production of oysters, the available quahaug
territory is necessarily reduced. Over this question endless disputes
have arisen. The problem is undoubtedly one requiring delicate adjustment;
but there is no reason why these two industries should not
flourish side by side, as there would be plenty of room for both if all
the available territory were properly utilized.</p>

<p>There is one important feature of this problem, however, which the
present laws have wholly failed to recognize. Wherever practicable,
the best of the quahaug territory should not be granted; and as far as
possible, the oystermen should utilize only those tracts of territory which
are not naturally very productive of quahaugs.</p>


<h3><i>The Oyster Industry.</i></h3>

<p>For the benefit of those who perhaps are not familiar with the methods
employed in the oyster industry, the following brief account is given:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <i>Selecting the Grant.</i>&mdash;The oysterman, in selecting a grant, has
to consider first the nature of the soil; and secondly, the location as
influencing the growth of the oyster. Not less important is the quality
of the oyster, which means not only a good price, but also readiness
of sale, as the oysters produced in certain localities are especially desirable
in appearance and flavor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>As the oyster will not grow on all kinds of bottom, but demands a
firm soil, free from soft mud and shifting sand, the oyster area of the
State is naturally limited. Usually but part of an oysterman's grant
is suitable for the cultivation of oysters, and he is forced to let the
rest of the territory lie idle, unless he can, with shells or gravel, artificially
change this waste area into suitable ground. Shifting sand perhaps
can never be made suitable for oysters; but many acres of soft
mud can be made productive, if the oysterman only has a reasonable
guarantee that he would receive the results of his labor.</p>

<p>While the oyster culture is limited by the nature of the bottom, it
is also restricted by other conditions. The salinity of the water has
much to do with the rapidity of growth, and the oysters seem to thrive
in localities where a slight amount of fresh water enters. The amount
of food in the water is the principal factor in the rate of growth, and
to this is due the fact that the rate of growth varies considerably in
different localities. As a rule, the beds with good circulation of water
(<i>i.e.</i>, currents) show the more rapid growth.</p>

<p>II. <i>Collecting the "Seed."</i>&mdash;The term "seed" is applied to one,
two, three and even four year old oysters which the oystermen plant
on their grants. These grants are in reality salt-water gardens, requiring
constant supervision; and the obtaining of the "seed" for planting
is a most important consideration. The gathering of the oyster "seed"
is a simple process, but one which requires much research.</p>

<p>Early in the summer, usually during the months of June and July
in these waters, the Massachusetts oyster spawns. Both sperm from
the adult male and the eggs from the adult female oysters are extruded
in considerable quantities into the water, and there the eggs are fertilized.
As fertilization is somewhat a matter of accident, undoubtedly
the great majority of eggs never develop. The fertilized eggs pass
rapidly through various changes in the course of a few hours, and
emerge as microscopic embryos, with thin, transparent coverings. At
this period these forms are free swimming, and are found in great
numbers in the water. They are extremely delicate, and great quantities
are destroyed by natural agencies, such as cold storms, sudden
changes in temperature, etc. They likewise are subject to the depredations
of all sorts of marine creatures, and comparatively few in proportion
survive. The survivors, after leading this free-swimming
existence for several days, settle to the bottom, where they attach themselves
by a calcareous fixative to stones, shells, pieces of wood, etc.
Here, unless buried by silt and soft mud or killed by exposure, poisonous
pollution, etc., the young oyster rapidly becomes of a size suitable
for planting.</p>

<p>The economic utilization of this scientific knowledge is as follows:
shells offer a very good surface for the attachment of the young oyster,
and many thousand bushels are annually strewn over the bottom previous
to the spawning season. Considerable judgment is needed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
choosing the right time to plant these shells, which after a few weeks
in the water become so coated with slime that fixation of the "spat"
becomes impossible. In Massachusetts the area between high and low
water mark has been found by experiment to be the most valuable
territory for this purpose, as shells planted here collect the heaviest
set and can be handled with the least expense. A projecting sand bar
or point with a current is also well adapted for catching oyster spat.</p>

<p>The scallop shell is the most serviceable in spat collecting, because it
is more brittle, and the clusters of oysters when attached are readily
broken apart. After the oysterman has obtained a successful set, he
allows the young oysters to obtain a suitable growth before he makes
a final planting, either in the spring or fall.</p>

<p>III. <i>Size of the "Seed" used for Planting.</i>&mdash;While many oysters
are raised from native spat in the Buzzards Bay district, the greater
part of the seed is purchased in Connecticut and Long Island, and is
carried in schooners or steamers to Massachusetts waters. The usual
price ranges from 35 cents to $1 per bushel, according to size and quality.
The oystermen cannot always choose the size of "seed" they desire
for planting, as the set of any one year is very uncertain, and several
seasons may pass before a large quantity of "seed" can be obtained.
Thus the oyster planters are forced to take whatever size they can obtain,
whether it be two, three or four year old "seed." As a rule, the
small "seed" is most in demand, as it means relatively faster growth
and less money invested. Often, when the ground is most favorable for
fattening, large oysters are preferred for planting, and certain oystermen
make this line of work a specialty. Certain localities where there
is plenty of lime in the water are well adapted for growth, and yet
produce poor-"meated" oysters, while in other grounds the reverse
is true. The oystermen occasionally by a double transfer utilize both
grounds, planting oyster "seed" for the first few years in the rapid-growing
localities, and then transplanting the large oysters to the
"fattening" ground six months before marketing.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Preparing the Grant.</i>&mdash;The first step in preparing the grant
is to remove all d&eacute;bris. In the deep water, this is usually done by dredging;
in the shallow water, by whatever means is the easiest. If the
bottom is of firm soil, the grant is then ready for planting; however,
if the soil is soft mud, it is necessary to shell the bottom in order to
give it greater firmness. The oysterman continually has to keep a sharp
lookout in order to protect his grant from enemies such as the starfish
and the oyster drill, and to keep it clear of seaweed and other matter
which would interfere with the growth of the oyster.</p>

<p>V. <i>Sowing the "Seed."</i>&mdash;The "seed" oysters are planted on the
prepared bed by scattering them with shovels or scoops from the boats
and scows. The oysterman, knowing the maximum amount of "seed"
the bed will grow to the best advantage, plants the required number,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
taking care that the oysters are properly scattered, as for the best
growth oysters should lie separate and not in crowded masses. The
amount of "seed" that can be planted on a given area depends upon
the natural conditions of the locality.</p>

<p>VI. <i>Enemies.</i>&mdash;The oyster, having passed through the countless
dangers of his embryonic career, is still harassed by several enemies.
Of these, the most destructive is the starfish. This animal, commonly
known as the "five-finger," occurs along the entire Massachusetts
coast, and is especially abundant in Buzzards Bay. Occasionally whole
oyster beds are wiped out by this pest, which sweeps over the ground
in vast armies. The method of attack of the starfish is unique. By
exerting with its tube feet a steady pull in opposite directions on both
valves of the shell of the victim, the starfish tires the contracted muscle
of the oyster, and the shells open. The starfish then extrudes its
stomach so as to enwrap the prey, and in this curious manner devours
the oyster.</p>

<p>A close second to the starfish in amount of damage is the oyster
"drill" or "borer" (<i>Urosalpinx cinerea</i>). This little mollusk with
its rasping tongue drills a small hole through the shell of the oyster,
and then sucks out the contents.</p>

<p>A third enemy, according to the oyster planters, is the "winkle"
(<i>Fulgur carica</i> and <i>F. caniculatus</i>). The method of attack is somewhat
obscure.</p>

<p>Besides this dangerous trio of living enemies, the oyster is subject
to constant peril from inanimate agencies. Probably the greatest of
these is shifting bottom. Where oysters are grown on sandy soil, the
violent waves of winter storms frequently tear up the bottom, or else
the force of currents is such as to kill the oysters by completely burying
them in the sand. Again, if the oysters are growing in very
muddy bottom they are constantly liable to be smothered in the slimy
ooze. Ice in winter frequently tears oysters from their beds and bears
them to some unfavorable environment, where they soon die.</p>

<p>VII. <i>Harvesting the Oysters.</i>&mdash;The oysterman completes his planting
about June 1. During the summer months, the growing period
of the oyster, the grants remain idle except for the care and supervision
of the oystermen. As the oyster takes from three to five years
to attain its growth, the oysterman practically harvests but one-fourth
to one-third of his entire stock each year, beginning about September
1 and continuing through the winter as the weather permits.</p>

<p>In winter the oysterman, to keep up the market supply, beds "culled"
oysters near the shore, where he can tong them through the ice whenever
it is impossible to obtain oysters from his grant.</p>

<p>The implements used in gathering the oyster harvest are of three
kinds: tongs, dredges and rakes. Tongs are employed principally by
the smaller oyster growers, and on ground where the water is com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>paratively
shallow. A pair of tongs is really a pair of long-handled
rakes, fastened together like a pair of shears. The pole, corresponding
to the blade of the shears, varies from 8 to 16 feet in length. The
rakes, some 2 to 2&frac12; feet broad, are so fitted to the end of the poles
that when extended by spreading the handles they rest upon the bottom
parallel to each other. These tongs are usually worked from skiffs
or flat-bottomed boats, the oystermen first separating the tips of the
handles and then bringing them together, thus causing a corresponding
movement of the two rakes, which with their 2-inch iron teeth gather
in all the intervening oysters. The tongs with their burden of oysters
are then lifted into the boat, emptied, and the process repeated.</p>

<p>Dredging is a much faster and less laborious method of oystering
than tonging, and can be carried on over a much larger territory.
The oyster dredge consists of a bag of woven iron rings attached to
an iron framework. From each corner of the framework iron rods
extend, converging at a point some feet away. At this point the rope
is attached, by which the dredge is dragged from either a sail or
power boat. The blade, resting horizontally on the surface, is armed
with teeth which rake the oysters into the bag. When this bag, which
holds from 3 to 8 bushels, is full, the dredge is raised, usually by a
windlass worked by steam, gasolene or hand power, as the case may
be, its contents dumped out and the dredge lowered for another haul.</p>

<p>Rakes, the third implement in general use, are not employed as
extensively as tongs or dredges, but are used in still water, where the
bottom is suitable.</p>

<p>VIII. <i>Marketing.</i>&mdash;The "catch" as soon as it is dredged or tonged
is brought in boats to the oyster houses, where men with hatchets or
similar implements break apart the clustered oysters and cast aside
the empty shells, bits of rock, etc. Three different varieties of marketable
oysters are usually sorted out, according to size: (1) large, (2)
medium and (3) small. The respective sizes vary somewhat with the
locality, demands of the market and the season; but the large oysters
commonly count about 900 to the barrel, the medium 1,000 or more,
while the small run 1,200 or over.</p>

<p>The different sizes as they are sorted out are packed in barrels and
are then ready for shipment. The principal markets are of course
New York and Boston, though the demand farther inland is increasing,
and shipments to Chicago or places even farther west are frequently
made.</p>


<h3><i>General Statistics.</i></h3>

<p>The following facts concerning the oyster industry have been compiled
from the written statements of the different oystermen. Complete
returns have not been received from Wareham, Barnstable, and
Falmouth, while possibly a few oystermen in the other towns have
been overlooked. Falmouth raises but few oysters for the market and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
these returns have been recorded, the remaining oystermen merely
planting for their own use. In the towns of Barnstable and Wareham
about four-fifths of the oystermen have made returns. The facts
given in the following tables are based only on the returns at hand,
and therefore do not give a complete report for these two towns.</p>

<h3><i>Wellfleet.</i></h3>

<p>For the past thirty years there has been an extensive oyster industry
at Wellfleet, and many grants have been taken out in the waters of
Wellfleet Bay, which possesses some of the best oyster ground in the
State. In spite of the success of the past years, the industry is declining,
indicating, possibly, that after 1910 no more grants will be
leased.</p>

<p>Four parts of the bay are taken up by oyster grants in the vicinity
of: (1) Mayo's Beach; (2) Great Island; (3) Indian Neck; (4) Lieutenant's
Island.</p>

<p>(1) Nine grants, covering an area of 176 acres of both flats and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
deeper water, extend out from Mayo's Beach a distance of 1,500 feet.
These grants extend along shore from Commercial Wharf to Egg
Island, a distance of 3,500 feet. Seven of these grants have each a
shore extension of 200 feet, the other 2 having 600 and 1,500 feet
respectively. The principal planting on these grants is done by D.
Atwood &amp; Co.</p>

<p>(2) On the west side of the bay, along the shores of Great Island
and Beach Hill, there are 7 grants which are now worked. Originally
there were 12 grants in this locality, but 5 of them expired some time
ago. The area included in these 5 grants is 500 acres, while the entire
granted area covers 708 acres. Wright &amp; Willis, R. R. Higgins and
L. D. Baker have done most of the planting on these grants in the
past few years.</p>

<p>(3) On the east side of the bay, near Indian Neck, are 5 grants,
comprising 224 acres. J. A. Stubbs does all the planting here. A
single grant of 11 acres of flats is held in Duck Creek Cove by J. C.
Wiles. These grants extend along the shore for 2,000 yards and run
out into the bay for 1,000 yards.</p>

<p>(4) Off Lieutenant's Island are 8 grants, comprising a total area
of 1,062 acres. Only 3 of these, comprising 559 acres, are now worked.
Joseph Crosby of Osterville is the principal planter on these grants.</p>

<p>From the statistical returns of the oyster planters it is found that
23 grants are now held for oyster planting, comprising an area of
967 acres; 810 acres, or 83 per cent. of this area, is suitable for oyster
culture. There is very little soft mud bottom, only 82 acres, while
the shifting sand area is 75 acres.</p>

<p>The total area of grants ever leased at Wellfleet comprises 2,182
acres, of which 1,473 are now held. The average depth of water over
these grants at mean low tide is 4 feet, the extremes running from
1 to 12 feet.</p>

<p>Most of the oystering is done by dredging, two large gasolene oyster
boats, the "Cultivator" and the "Marion," being employed for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
purpose. Tongs are also used extensively. Fourteen men are engaged
from six to twelve months each year in the oyster business.</p>

<p>The production for 1906-07 was 22,500 bushels of marketable oysters,
valued at $24,850; and 1,000 bushels of "seed," worth approximately
$1,000. Most of the planted "seed" is obtained from Long Island
and Connecticut.</p>

<p>The damage from the natural enemies of the oyster is reported as
very slight.</p>

<p>The Wellfleet oyster has a peculiar salty flavor not possessed by other
oysters. For some trade this is preferred, while for others it is not
so desirable. Before marketing the extreme saltiness is sometimes removed
by floating the oysters in Duck Creek, where the water is less
salt, using large, scow-like floats, 30 by 15 feet.</p>

<p>Several Boston firms are engaged in oyster culture at Wellfleet, including
D. Atwood &amp; Co., J. A. Stubbs and R. R. Higgins.</p>

<p>For years there has been a conflict between the quahaugers and the
oystermen at Wellfleet. This is very natural, owing to the rivalry
between the two industries and the rapid rise of the quahaug fishery
in the last fifteen years. Owing to their greater number, the quahaugers
have obtained the upper hand in town affairs, with the result
that in 1910, when all the oyster leases run out, it is said that no more
will be granted, and the oyster business of Wellfleet will come to an
end. This is especially unfortunate for the town, as there is room
for both industries, and the destruction of either one would be a great
financial loss. It is hoped that some means can be devised to straighten
out the difficulties between the opposing factions before either industry
is ruined.</p>

<p>But little oyster spat has ever been caught in Wellfleet Bay. That
oysters will set there is evidenced by the young "seed" caught on
the piles of the wharves and on stones and rocks around the harbor. It
is noteworthy that at Wellfleet the spat sets only between the tide
lines, and does not catch where water is constantly over the ground.
This is directly contrary to the conditions in Long Island Sound, where
the set is caught in deep water. E. P. Cook and J. A. Stubbs have tried
spat collecting in Herring River for several years, with the results
of one or two good sets, the best being caught by Mr. Cook in 1906.
The other years have proved failures in this line. There is no question
but that oyster spat can be profitably caught if sufficient interest is
taken in the matter.</p>

<p>The early laws were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In 1772 a law having been enacted by the General Court, regulating the
taking of oysters in Billingsgate Bay, an amendment to that act was now
asked by the town, namely, that during the summer months oysters shall
not be taken to market, nor fished by the inhabitants of the town for their
own use during the months of July and August.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1773:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That, inasmuch as the oyster fishery, which is of great value to the town
and of great advantage to the Province, has received detriment from persons
taking young oysters, the enactment of more stringent regulations are
necessary to prevent their destruction.</p></div>

<p>These early laws show that the natural oyster beds were highly prized
by the Inhabitants in colonial days, and that measures, even then, were
necessary to prevent their extinction. At the present time Wellfleet
has no other regulations than the general oyster laws of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>The history of the oyster industry of Wellfleet can be divided into
three periods: (1) the natural oyster fishery; (2) the "bedding" of
southern oysters; (3) oyster planting.</p>

<p>(1) <i>The Natural Oyster Beds of Wellfleet.</i>&mdash;The first settlers found
a natural oyster bed near Hitchin's Creek, or Silver Spring, in 1644,
and it is said that oysters were very abundant at that time. Old
shells are occasionally dredged or raked up at the present day from
these beds. The Rev. Enoch Pratt, in his "History of Eastham, Wellfleet
and Orleans," gives the following account of this early oyster
industry:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Oysters were found in great abundance on the flats at the first settlement
[1644], but at this time [1770] the inhabitants had so increased and
such quantities were taken for consumption and for the Boston market,
that it became necessary, to prevent their entire destruction, for the district
to take measures to preserve and propagate them.... Shops and
stands were opened in Boston, Salem, Portland and other places, where
the oysters were sold in quantities to suit the purchaser.</p>

<p>In 1775 all the oysters in the bay died. What caused their destruction
is not certainly known, but it is supposed that as, at this time, a large
number of blackfish died and came on shore, where their carcasses remained,
producing a very filthy condition of the water, it caused this mortality.</p></div>

<p>A more probable explanation is given by Mr. E. P. Cook of Wellfleet.
The early inhabitants, not knowing the value of the natural shell beds
for catching the spat, greedily took every shell and burned them into
lime as a fertilizer for their farms and plaster for their houses. There
was once a fine strip of woods near this original oyster rock, but this
was cut down, and the sand gradually washed over the beds, killing
the young oysters. To these two causes can be attributed the final destruction
of the natural beds in 1775.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Bedding of Southern Oysters.</i>&mdash;After the destruction of
the natural beds, an important industry arose in the "bedding" of
southern oysters for northern trade. Privileges for bedding oysters
on the flats were granted to a number of oyster firms. These men
hired schooners in the latter part of the winter or the early spring,
which went to the southern oyster grounds and brought back loads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
of oysters. These oysters were spread or bedded over the leased flats
of the harbor, where they remained until the following fall, when they
were taken up for market. In this way the oysters gained in size by
the summer's growth, and were fattened for market. Considerable trade
sprang up in the carrying of oysters, and many vessels were engaged
in this traffic. In 1841 Mr. Gould, the conchologist, states that 120 men,
with 30 vessels of about 40 tons each, were employed for three months
of the year, and brought to the town an annual revenue of $8,000.</p>

<p>In 1841 Capt. William Dill is credited with bringing into Wellfleet
the first cargo from Virginia, which started a large trade in Chesapeake
oysters. Mr. Ernest Ingersoll makes the following statement concerning
the Virginia trade:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Nevertheless, it was not until about 1845 or 1850 that the business began
to confine itself to Virginia oysters, and a large business to be done. At
its height, about 1850, it is probable that more than 100,000 bushels a
year were laid down in the harbor; some say 150,000.... The favorite
ground was at the mouth of Herring River.</p></div>

<p>The Rev. Enoch Pratt writes, in 1844:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The inhabitants of the town tried the experiment of bringing oysters
from the south and laying them down on the flats, which succeeded well.
In the course of a year they doubled their size and their quality was much
improved. This soon became a large business, and a number of vessels
have been employed in the spring of every year in bringing them here.
The number of bushels which are now [1844] annually brought is about
60,000. Nearly all the oyster shops and stands in Boston, and other cities
and towns in this State, are supplied from this place, and are kept by
persons belonging to the town. This business affords a living for many
families.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Ernest Ingersoll thus describes the decline of the oyster trade
in 1870:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The war of the rebellion, however, interfered somewhat with the oyster
trade, and it began to decline so far as Wellfleet was concerned. Then the
various dealers in northern ports, having learned something, began to bed
near home in their own harbors, and so saved freightage. Finally, the
steamers from Norfolk and the railways entered into so serious a competition
that fully ten years ago [1870] Wellfleet Bay was wholly deserted by
the oystermen as a bedding ground, though her vessels still continue to
carry cargoes in winter from Virginia to Boston, Portland, Salem, Portsmouth
and the Providence River, to supply the active trade and fill the
new beds, which the dealers at these various ports had learned could be
established at home. The reader thus discovers how important a part
Wellfleet has played in the history of the oyster trade of New England. A
hundred thousand bushels of the bivalves once grew fat along her water
front, and thousands of dollars were dispensed to the citizens in the industry
they created. Now [1880] a little experimental propagation, to the
value of a few hundred dollars, and about 6,000 bushels of bedded oysters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
from Virginia, worth perhaps $5,000 when sold, form the total active business.
The oyster fleet, however, remains, though greatly diminished, and
carrying its cargoes to Boston, Portland and elsewhere, instead of bringing
them to be laid down in the home harbor. It will be long before Wellfleet,
and its neighbor, Provincetown, lose the prestige of old custom as oyster
carriers.</p></div>

<p>(3) <i>Oyster Raising.</i>&mdash;In 1876 the first attempt to raise oysters from
"seed" at Wellfleet, is said to have been made by E. P. Cook, who
obtained a grant from the town of about 30 acres, on which were
planted 500 bushels of "seed" from Somerset, Mass. The "Oysterman"
of Dec. 20, 1906, gives the following account of oyster planting
at Wellfleet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In 1876 our informant, Mr. E. P. Cook, conceived the idea that these
waters could grow "seed" oysters as well as fatten big stock. He went
to Somerset, Mass., and got a carload of 500 bushels and planted them.
A few had previously been planted but with ill success. The people laughed
at him for dumping his good money overboard. He was the first man to
lease a piece of oyster ground from the State, and of course had his pick,
which was 600 feet on the shore next to the Silver Spring, the original spot
of the natural rocks. Mr. Cook here showed his acumen as a culturist. The
next spring they had made a remarkable growth, and all had lived. Then
there was a stampede of the fellows who laughed, to get some ground, too.
Soon every inch of available ground had been taken up. We mention the
following who took up plats: Solomon Higgins, I. C. Young, Benjamin
Oliver, Daniel Oliver, Edward Oliver, Cornelius Rogers, William Smith, S. B.
Rich, Theodore Brown, Stephen Young. These men did not all plant. The
next year Mr. Cook bought 500 bushels more, and now he had 1,000 bushels
on his grounds. These were two-year-old plants, and when they had laid
there three years he sold these primitive beauties for $5 per barrel. Some
time after this he bought Mr. Rich's plot. Subsequently Mr. Cook sold
400 of his 600 feet to R. R. Higgins, the founder of the famous oyster-packing
house by that name. This same man bought the 200 feet of
Solomon Higgins. Now this house had 600 feet of shore ground. R. R.
Higgins was the first wholesaler with capital invested in the culture of the
Cape Cod oysters. Finally, this house absorbed all the ground Cook had.
Eight years after this the Wright &amp; Willis firm came on the scene; that
period had elapsed since the first cargo of "seed" had been freighted here.
They bought the remainder of the Solomon Higgins grant. Then Mr. Cook
took out another grant below Smalley's Bar. Capt. Albert Harding and
Capt. D. A. Newcomb took out leases. In 1892 Mr. Cook sold his lease to
the D. Atwood Company. Then Mr. Cook bought the Capt. Albert Harding
lease and sold the right to plant on it, the law then not allowing the lessee
to turn over the grant in toto. Then H. &amp; R. Atwood became interested
here. About this time some friction between the planters and clammers
existed, but it should be remembered that the planters occupied only about
200 of the 2,400 acres involved in this dispute. Then it was that J. A.
Stubbs came on the stage of activity, and Mr. Cook secured a lease for this
wholesale concern.</p></div>

<h3><i>Eastham.</i></h3>

<p>The oyster industry of Eastham is closely associated with the Wellfleet
industry, and practically all the business is carried on by Wellfleet
firms.</p>

<p>The grants extend along the western shore from the Eastham-Wellfleet
line south, running out into the bay a distance of 1 mile. The
average width of these grants is 900 feet. Twenty-four grants have
been given out by the selectmen, but only 12 of these are in existence
at the present time, the others having lapsed for non-payment of dues.
(The town charges $3 for the original grant, and $1 each year thereafter).
The area of the grants is 800 acres, of which only 125 acres
are under cultivation. As all the business, which is but small, is done
by Wellfleet firms, the statistics of the industry are included in the
Wellfleet report. All the grants, as at Wellfleet, expire in 1910.</p>


<h3><i>Orleans.</i></h3>

<p>There are 5 grants on the west coast of the town, but practically
nothing is done in the oyster business. The oyster industry of Orleans is
a dead issue, and quahaugers dig at will over all the granted territory.</p>

<p>The grants are all eight to nine years old, and will not be renewed,
as they are said to be unconstitutional, since the waters of Eastham
and Orleans are common, and the consent of Eastham was not obtained
when they were granted. The real reason for not renewing
them will be because they are not profitable. The sand shifts on
a good deal of the territory, and where the water is too deep for
shifting, oyster culture does not seem to pay.</p>

<p>Four years ago 15,000 bushels of two-year-old "seed" was sent
here from Connecticut. The greater part of this "seed" died in
transportation, and much of the remainder was killed by the shifting
sand. Two years ago (1905) 3,000 bushels of marketable oysters were
shipped from Orleans; but little has been done since then. No set
has ever been caught here, although spat catches readily on the rocks
which lie between the tide lines.</p>


<h3><i>Chatham.</i></h3>

<p>The oyster furnishes an important industry for the town of Chatham,
which ranks next to Wellfleet and Cotuit in the production of
"Cape" oysters.</p>

<p>The oyster grants are all situated in Oyster Pond and Oyster Pond
River, covering an area of 65 acres of excellent bottom. Of this, 55
acres is hard bottom; 6 acres, soft mud; and 4 acres of coarse shifting
sand. The whole of Oyster Pond River and the most of the shore
waters of Oyster Pond are taken up by grants. The central part of
Oyster Pond possesses a soft bottom, and is therefore unsuited for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
oyster culture. The depth of water over the grants varies from dry
to 6 feet at low tide.</p>

<p>Records show that a natural oyster bed once existed in Oyster Pond,
as in 1802 "excellent oysters, but scarce," were reported. Even now
old shell heaps are found, which contain extremely large oyster shells,
and indicate that the Indians used these oysters for food. Indeed,
the name, Oyster Pond, was given long before grants were issued,
and doubtless received this name because of these natural oysters.</p>

<p>No natural oysters remained in 1877, when the first grants were
issued to George S. Atwood, John Vanhise, Jonathan Small, Stephen
Gould and Frank Lanpier. The last three named held together one
grant in Oyster Pond River; Atwood's grant was in Oyster Pond;
while Vanhise's grant was partly in Oyster Pond and partly in Stage
harbor, where oyster culture was a failure. The planting was not very
successful at first, owing to a lack of proper methods.</p>

<p>These grants were issued in 1874 for a term of twenty years. The
next series of grants were issued for ten years, and in 1893 the first
grants were renewed for the same length of time. Since the period
of the twenty-year grants there have been two ten-year leases, and
the present leases will expire in 1911.</p>

<p>A town regulation restricts the oyster grants to the southern waters
of the town, and allows no grants to be given in the waters of Pleasant
Bay, where there is considerable territory which might be suitable for
oyster raising. As all the available territory is now taken up in Oyster
Pond, no more grants can be issued.</p>

<p>The method of obtaining a grant by a resident of the town is to
choose the locality, stake out the grant and report the same to the
selectmen, who will grant a license if the bounds are satisfactorily
described, and no part of another grant is included. The price of the
license, which runs for a period of ten years, is $2, and 50 cents is
charged for recording it. No regular survey of the grant is made.
Taxes are paid yearly on stock and working capital.</p>

<p>Owing to the shallow water, most of the work is done by tonging.
Flat scows, 25 by 10 feet, are generally used for this work, as they
afford excellent footing for the oysterman in tonging and plenty of
room for the oysters. These scows, which have a capacity of 100
bushels, can be anchored by stakes or iron piping, and definite areas
covered by the tonger. In the fall the oystermen make their "culls"
on these scows. Chatham is the only town in Massachusetts where
scows are in general use. Dredging is done only to a limited extent
by 3 oystermen, the others all using tongs. Twenty men are engaged
from four to six months of the year in the oyster business at Chatham.</p>

<p>The production for 1906-07 was 14,550 bushels, valued at $23,987.
The oyster industry has been increasing every year, the production for
1906-07 being one-third more than the 1905-06 output. The oystermen
are unanimous in saying that the oyster business of Chatham is steadily
improving.</p>

<p>No "seed" oysters are raised in Chatham, as no large set has ever
been caught, and all attempts in this line have proved unsuccessful.
All the "seed" oysters are brought from Greenport, L. I. These run
from two to four years old, the larger oysters being preferred. As a
rule, oystermen are forced to take what they can get when they buy seed.</p>

<p>The only natural enemy which infests the Chatham oyster is the
oyster drill (<i>Urosalpinx cinerea</i>). The damage done by this pest is
slight, amounting to nearly $800 annually.</p>


<h3><i>Harwich.</i></h3>

<p>No oyster industry is now carried on in the town of Harwich. A
natural oyster bed once existed in Herring River, and occasionally a
few oysters can be picked up at the present time; but the bed is practically
fished out. This bed once extended a distance of three-quarters
of a mile in the lower part of the river.</p>

<p>In 1824 an act was passed to prevent "the wilful destruction of
oysters and other shellfish in the town of Harwich," which shows that
even as early as 1824 the natural bed in Herring River was on the
verge of depletion.</p>


<h3><i>Dennis and Yarmouth.</i></h3>

<p>The oyster industries of Dennis and Yarmouth are so connected
that they will have to be considered as belonging to one town.</p>

<p>Four grants have been leased in the two towns, but only 2 of these
are worked. Three grants are situated in Bass River, while the fourth,
which is not operated, owing to the shifting sand, lies outside Dog
Fish Bar. The 2 grants which are worked are situated in Bass River,
and comprise an area of 10 acres of hard bottom, all of which is suitable
for oyster culture. The Bass River grants, which are taxed at
the valuation of $1,000 apiece, expire in 1914.</p>

<p>Mill Creek, in West Yarmouth, one of the most valuable shellfish
areas in the town, originally contained a natural oyster bed which
extended from the mouth of the creek up for 1,000 feet, comprising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
an area of 2-1/3 acres. Nevertheless, this was granted in 1895 for a
period of ten years. Two years ago the lease expired, and it is said
that the oysters have come in again in abundance.</p>

<p>All along the south shore of the two towns "seed" oysters, which
have been washed out of Mill Creek, can be picked up. A small amount
of "seed" is raised on the grants, but this is not enough to furnish
the requisite amount required for planting purposes, so about 2,500
bushels is annually brought into the town from Oyster Bay, L. I.</p>

<p>No damage is done in these waters by the natural enemies of the
oyster, as both the starfish and oyster drill are very scarce.</p>

<p>One thousand bushels of marketable oysters, valued at $1,500, were
shipped in the season of 1906-07.</p>

<p>Three men are engaged for a period of seven and one-half months
in the oyster industry.</p>

<p>The oysters are taken by tonging from dories, as the water is comparatively
shallow. No dredging is done.</p>

<p>Yarmouth is the only town in the State which requires a license for
taking oysters from a natural bed.</p>


<h3><i>Barnstable.</i></h3>

<p>Barnstable is the great oyster town of the Commonwealth, as it
has the twofold distinction of possessing the most extensive industry
and producing the finest quality of oysters. The causes which have
brought the cultivation of oysters in this town to so flourishing a
condition have been fourfold: first, Barnstable has a long coast line,
much cut up by bays and rivers, which give it a very large available
area; secondly, this area is remarkably suited for the cultivation of
oysters, as it is for the most part hard, clean bottom, in comparatively
shallow water and well sheltered from storms; thirdly, there is little
damage from the enemies of the oyster,&mdash;the starfish, winkle and
drill, fourthly, the waters of the township are notably pure, free from
contamination, and well adapted for the production of a rapid-growing
oyster of excellent quality.</p>

<p>Barnstable township contains several villages, three of which, Cotuit,
Marston's Mills and Osterville, are prosperous centers of the oyster
fishery. Hyannis, a fourth village, once maintained a business of this
nature, which proved unprofitable and has now practically disappeared.
Oyster grants are scattered along the shores of Popponesset River and
Bay, in Cotuit harbor, Bluff Channel, South Bay, Osterville Narrows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
and at Marston's Mills. In addition, a large but indefinite territory
along the southern shore, as indicated on the map, is maintained as
experimental grants.</p>

<p>Cotuit is by far the most important center of the industry. Here
the fishery is conducted on an extensive scale. The white, clean sandy
bottom and the remarkably pure waters of the bay produce an oyster
with a bright, clear shell, which distinguishes it from oysters grown
elsewhere. This Cotuit oyster is much sought for by hotels and fancy
dealers, and is universally considered par excellence among Massachusetts
oysters.</p>

<p>Barnstable, though supporting an immense industry, has by no means
exhausted her latent resources. Extensive experiments to increase the
productive area of the town have been carried on for the past few
years. A strip of territory along the southern coast, some 4 miles
long and 3 miles wide, has been granted. This territory is of doubtful
utility, as the bottom is largely shifting sand exposed to the full force
of southerly gales. These grants have hardly been in force long enough
to demonstrate their possibilities, but it is probable that a large territory
may be thoroughly suitable for the future expansion of the oyster
industry.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, several oystermen did not make statistical returns,
thus rendering a complete record for the Barnstable oyster industry
impossible. The majority of the oystermen willingly responded, and
the present report comprises only those returns which have been sent in.</p>

<p>The total area comprised by the grants, 29 in number, is 188 acres,
of which 121 acres are of hard bottom, suitable for oyster culture.
There is very little shifting bottom. The usual Cotuit bottom is a clear
sand, which is especially favorable for the production of fine oysters.</p>

<p>Thirty-three men are employed from six to eight months each year
in the industry, which gave in 1906-07 a production of 25,850 bushels
of marketable oysters, valued at $48,050. Except for a small natural
oyster bed at Centerville, no "seed" is caught in Barnstable, and is
all brought from Long Island and Connecticut. Several firms plant
only large oysters, bedding them in the spring and taking them up
the following fall, when they have acquired the Cotuit flavor.</p>

<h3><i>Mashpee.</i></h3>

<p>The oyster industry of Mashpee is rather limited. Five grants
exist in the west channel of Popponesset River, covering practically
all the territory. Only about 5 to 10 acres of this territory is suitable
for oyster culture. The ground granted for oysters is used indiscriminately
for quahauging and scalloping, and seems to be almost
public property.</p>

<p>But one man is engaged in the oyster business, and he rarely ships
any, but peddles them around the community. No "seed" is caught.
Starfish and oyster drills are very scarce. A cat boat, dory and tongs
constitute the capital invested, which is valued at $200. The annual
production is valued at $100.</p>


<h3><i>Falmouth.</i></h3>

<p>The oyster industry of Falmouth is conducted on the south side of
the town, in the waters of Waquoit Bay. There are no oysters on
the Buzzards Bay side of the town.</p>

<p>According to the town records, there are 22 grants in existence.
These grants are mostly small, not averaging more than 2 to 10 acres,
and are but little cultivated. Returns from 6 of these grants, which
comprise all the territory worked for market, are alone used for the
statistical figures.</p>

<p>The best oyster territory is in Waquoit Bay and Child's River. In
Waquoit Bay 6 acres are granted, 4&frac12; acres of which is hard bottom,
suitable for oyster culture. In Child's River the grants comprise 20
acres, two-thirds of which, or 13 acres, is hard bottom. Altogether,
some 44 acres are granted, and, although a good deal of the surface is
muddy, there are 23 acres of very fair oyster ground.</p>

<p>No business is made of raising "seed," but from two to three year
old "seed" is shipped from Greenport, L. I., and replanted.</p>

<p>In 1906-07, 3,012 bushels of marketable oysters, valued at $6,025,
were shipped. Many of the grants are leased to men who raise oysters
for their own use only, while but few make a business of shipping
oysters.</p>

<p>The only enemy is the oyster drill, which does but slight damage here.</p>

<p>Three men are engaged for nine months each year in the oyster industry
at Falmouth; while 5 or more run grants for their own use.</p>

<h3><i>Buzzards Bay District.</i></h3>

<p>The Buzzards Bay oyster industry is in a state verging on chaos.
In some specially favored localities it is in a flourishing condition; in
others hardly less favorable it is almost completely stagnant. Great
natural advantages exist, which if properly utilized would create a
business of immense proportions. These resources are for the most
part but poorly improved, and in many cases are neglected altogether.
A spirit of uncertainty, which discourages confidence and checks initiative,
seems to pervade the business atmosphere. Amid this uncertainty
and conflicting forces, one fact, at once the starting point of the whole
difficulty and at the same time the sole solution of the problem, stands
out vividly clear. This is the need of proper <i>legislation</i>.</p>

<p>The troubles which beset the Buzzards Bay oyster industry are
directly traceable to defects in the present legislative system. These
defects are both active and passive. In some cases unwise and illogical
laws are in operation, which hamper business activity; in other cases
laws for which there is a crying need are laid aside or neglected. A
reform in certain aspects of town supervision is the demand of the
hour. Until the present system receives an overhauling, it is doubtful
if the industry will ever experience full prosperity.</p>

<p>In order to gain a clear insight into the difficulties which darken
the immediate outlook in this region, it will be necessary to take a
brief survey of the history and present status of the industry.</p>

<p>The beginnings of the oyster fishery in Buzzards Bay arose from the
exploitation and subsequent depletion of the natural beds. These beds,
of which there are several scattered along the coast from Bourne to
Mattapoisett, furnished for a long time a large annual output of
oysters. In the early '70's the supply began to decrease rapidly, and
the fear of total extermination caused the selectmen of Marion, Wareham
and Sandwich (Bourne) to attempt a strict supervision of the
fishery. These attempts were in all cases unsatisfactory, and about 1875
the artificial culture of oysters began almost simultaneously in the
three towns by the issue of licenses or grants to private individuals.
The measure was popular from the first. Almost all the available land
was speedily appropriated, and a flourishing but exotic industry, stimulated
by a considerable outlay of capital, burst into life.</p>

<p>At Marion the new business lasted precisely fifteen years. The industry
was largely a losing venture. The oysters did not grow well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
and were of inferior quality. In time, doubtless, when the causes which
produced these effects had been studied, a stable and well-ordered industry
would have resulted. It is but natural to assume that where
oysters grew in a "wild" state, cultivated ones could likewise be grown.
Such an outcome, however, was not destined to follow. The grants
had been so given that they all expired at the same time. When this
date arrived, the majority of the inhabitants of Marion were of the
opinion that the oyster grants would yield far better returns if utilized
merely for the quahaugs which grew naturally on them, and the
whole harbor was consequently thrown open as common ground. From
that date the quahaug fishery has waned almost to the point of extinction,
but no efforts have been made to resurrect the old oyster
industry, which has practically disappeared.</p>

<p>At Bourne the industry began with bright prospects. The present
business, though somewhat impoverished, still possesses those inherent
resources which are capable of developing a more extensive industry.</p>

<p>At Wareham the business was of slower growth and more logical
development, and it has continued to increase, until at present the
town possesses an important industry. It has struggled with many
problems which have retarded its growth, and which still embarrass it.
These are primarily problems of legislation, as the industry stands in
need of better regulations before it can attain its maximum development.</p>

<p>In all these difficulties, which have been briefly outlined and hinted
at, the main source of annoyance has been the strife between two rival
factions,&mdash;the oyster and quahaug interests. These interests have ever
been at war, and the result has been almost fatally destructive to both.
The questions at stake in this controversy have been broad in their
general interest. The quahaug industry is essentially democratic, representing
roughly labor as against capital, and demands that tidal flats
and waters be kept as common property for general use. The oyster
industry, on the other hand, is essentially exclusive, representing organized
capital, and maintains that oyster grants are as much the subject
of private ownership as farms and city lots. The whole aim of
legislation has been to reconcile these wholly opposite theories. The
problem has been complex and many-sided, and it is not strange that
the selectmen of the towns in question have been unable to harmonize
the two factions or pass regulations suitable to both parties. Certain
it is that in trying to benefit both they have benefited neither, and the
present confusion has resulted.</p>

<p>The matter is one certainly of sufficient importance to merit attention
from the State. It is not merely local. The whole Commonwealth is
interested vitally in the development of its industries, and it is unwise
to allow so important an industry as the oyster fishery to remain solely
in the hands of local authority, especially when local authority has
shown itself unable to cope with the problem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>The present system in vogue in the Buzzards Bay district is perhaps
unfair to both parties in its policy. The selectmen may lease an
unlimited number of grants, of an unlimited area, to any citizen or
number of citizens of the town in question. Theoretically at least they
may grant all the available area in sight to one man. There must
of course be the formality of a hearing, and sufficient pressure may
be and is frequently brought to bear upon the selectmen to retard them
from exercising the full extent of their authority; but nevertheless
the system is unjust to the majority, and it is small wonder that the
quahaug fishermen feel aggrieved that some of their former privileges
are thus curtailed. Furthermore, the clause which demands that these
grants should be used for the cultivation of oysters is oftentimes openly
evaded, and a good portion of the granted area, though not used for
oysters, is closed to the quahaugers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the oystermen, while apparently enjoying great
privileges, in reality are severely handicapped. An oysterman obtains
a grant perhaps with great difficulty, owing to opposition from the
quahaug men. He can carry on no extensive business without the
expenditure of considerable capital. If he "seeds" his grant, the first
two or three years are spent in the maturing of the first harvest. The
grant is given only for ten years; consequently, when it has run for
seven or eight years the owner is in doubt whether to plant any more
"seed," as he does not know that his license will be renewed and
naturally does not wish to plant a bed for his unknown successor.
Again, if he is fairly successful and wishes to expand his business,
he cannot without great risk invest in the costly equipment necessary
for such an enterprise, as he has no certainty of getting a sufficient
amount of territory or of keeping it any length of time. Furthermore,
additional complications arise from the disputes with owners of adjoining
shore property. This is particularly unfortunate, as this tidal
area along the shore is most valuable for the collection of oyster set
or "seed."</p>

<p>From the foregoing statements it appears that the oyster and quahaug
factions are in the position of two combatants who continue
to fight, while the object of the strife is lost to both. It is impossible
to handle so grave a problem by merely theorizing, but a few ideas
might be suggested as bearing favorably on the subject. It would
seem wise to refrain as far as possible from granting the best portions
of quahaug territory, for there is sufficient room for both industries
to flourish. Then, too, grants might be rented at so much per acre
as long as the owner desired within certain time limits, assuming that
he paid his annual rental and improved his grant. These and other
suggestions might be made which would seem an improvement over
the present circumstances; but it is doubtful if conditions can be much
bettered until some motive force and centralized authority is supplied
by proper legislation.</p>

<h3><i>Bourne.</i></h3>

<p>Bourne has long supported a promising oyster industry. In some
respects it has greater advantages for the extension of this business
than Wareham, but the invested capital, the annual product and the
resulting revenue are all overshadowed by those of its neighboring rival.
The great natural resources which Bourne possesses, its extensive available
area, its multiplicity of bays, inlets, islands and rivers,&mdash;these and
a variety of other causes combine to make it a most favorable locality
for the growth of oysters; and it is indeed an unfortunate circumstance
both for the shellfish interests of the community and the broader interests
of the State that so great a source of economic wealth should be so
little improved. The vexing questions which harass the oyster planters
of Wareham and hamper their efforts are present here in even greater
force. In many places where a flourishing business was once carried on
the industry is at a standstill, while nowhere does it evince that life
and activity which its decided advantages warrant.</p>

<p>The town books contain records of 135 grants in force to-day. No
accurate system of charting is in vogue except in the Monument River,
and no absolutely reliable data concerning the total area is available,
but the combined territory comprised in these grants aggregates nearly
600 acres. Of this territory, however, only a portion, and a relatively
small portion, is really improved; the remainder is either allowed to lie
dormant or is worked merely for the quahaugs which it produces. The
oyster territory of Bourne is divided into five distinct sections: the
Monument River section, the region about Mashnee Island, Toby Island
and vicinity, Basset's Island and the neighborhood of Wing's Neck, and
Pocasset and the Red Brook harbor or Cataumet district. Of these
five regions, the Monument River ranks first, both in the total area and
also in importance, and it is here that most of the business is carried on.</p>

<p>The statistical returns of the Bourne oystermen show that only 42
grants comprising 100 acres are worked. Of this 83 acres is hard
bottom suitable for oyster raising while the remaining 17 acres is mostly
soft mud.</p>

<p>Twenty-one men make a living from the industry. The production
for the year ending Aug. 1, 1907, amounted to 2,100 bushels of marketable
oysters, valued at $4,100, and 23,000 bushels of "seed," worth
$15,000. The methods employed in oyster culture here are similar to
those in use at Wareham. Thousands of bushels of shells, preferably
those of the scallop, are strewn over the bottom to collect the set, which
is then taken up and transferred to the proper grant or shipped for
sale. The two great enemies of the oyster, the borer or drill, and the
starfish, flourish here. The borer seems more destructive in those sections
which are comparatively sheltered, the starfish in more exposed
localities.</p>

<p>The history of the industry is one of picturesque variety. The
beginnings of the industry were bright with promise; the sudden growth
which followed was spectacular but erratic; and the difficulties which
soon arose plunged it into complications from which it emerged much
shattered and greatly declined. Originally there were three good
natural beds,&mdash;in Monument River, Barlow's River and Red Brook
harbor, respectively. These beds long supplied all the oysters produced,
and when in 1834 they began to be depleted, legislation was
enacted regulating them until 1863, when the town surveyed a number
of grants in the Monument River, each with an average area of 1&frac12; to 10
acres, and allowed one of these grants to every citizen desiring it, on
the payment of $2.50. These old beds still linger as rather uncertain
assets of the communal wealth. The Monument River grounds still
supply a fairly large harvest, the Barlow River has declined much
more, while the Cataumet beds are nearly extinct.</p>

<p>The shellfish laws of this region are of vital importance, as it is their
province to inaugurate order from chaos, put a stop to wasteful methods,
and take such steps as appear necessary for the proper development
of the industry. How greatly these laws fail in their mission is
abundantly shown by the present conditions of the fishery. The whole
situation is on the threshold of a change. What this change will be,
whether for better or worse, depends upon the legislation of the future.</p>


<h3><i>Wareham.</i></h3>

<p>Wareham is the second town in the State in the production of
oysters, being excelled in this respect by Barnstable alone. Its commanding
position at the head of Buzzards Bay, the numerous indentations
of its coast line, and the three rivers which lie partially within its
borders, give it a wide expanse of available territory exceptionally
favorable for the development of this shellfish industry.</p>

<p>The substantial success which has attended the oyster business at
Wareham has been attained by slow but steady growth. Many problems
have been encountered,&mdash;problems of local prejudice, opposition from
rival industries and the like; but these problems have simply hampered
the industry,&mdash;they have not sufficed to check its growth. At present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
the business seems firmly established, and can enter on its future career
of prosperity as soon as the barriers which block its progress shall have
been removed.</p>

<p>The town records show a total of 125 grants in operation to-day.
These grants are poorly described and for the most part unsurveyed,
but their total area approximates 1,000 acres. According to the
statistical returns of the oystermen, 70 grants, comprising 196 acres,
are under cultivation. Of this, 159 acres are of hard bottom, suitable
for oyster planting, while the waste area is equally soft mud and
shifting sand.</p>

<p>The catching of oyster "seed" at Wareham is more important than
the raising of marketable oysters; 22,100 bushels of seed, valued at
$12,090, were exported last year (1906-07). Thousands of bushels
of shells, chiefly those of the scallop, are planted yearly in shallow
water, to catch the set. The territory where these shells may be planted
to the best advantage is on the fringe of tidal flats which skirt the
coast. This area, however, which is consequently of considerable value,
is of doubtful ownership, being claimed both by the oystermen and also
by the owners of the adjacent shore property. The dispute arising
over this question has been most harmful to the industry.</p>

<p>The marketable oysters raised at Wareham are of very good quality.
There were 7,770 bushels of these oysters, valued at $12,790, produced
in 1906-07, and shipped mostly to New York and Boston. Altogether,
there are 26 men depending on this industry for a living.</p>

<p>Besides the grants, there are two native beds, one each in the Wareham
and the Weweantit rivers. These beds comprise nearly 80 acres,
and, though now greatly reduced, they still yield a considerable amount
of seed oysters.</p>

<p>The laws governing the industry here are similar to those at
Bourne. The ten-year grant prevails, with all its attendant evils to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
oysterman; while the quahaugers have abundant cause to complain,
from the fact that practically all the available territory has been
granted to the oystermen. While it is true that scarcely a third of this
land is utilized for the cultivation of oysters, it is likewise true that the
rights of the oystermen are by no means strictly observed by the quahauger.
There can be but one result of this policy,&mdash;endless wrangling
and confusion, and, in the end, loss to both parties. The unfortunate
thing about the whole matter is that most of this wastefulness is entirely
needless; but this is a problem for future legislation.</p>


<h3><i>Marion.</i></h3>

<p>The oyster industry at Marion is practically dead. The last grants
expired some ten or twelve years ago, and were never renewed. Of
the two original natural beds, that in Blankinship's Cove is now almost
entirely depleted, while the larger and more important bed in the
Weweantit River has greatly declined in importance. This bed, however,
still supplies all the marketable oysters produced within the town,
though the annual production is insignificant. From twenty-five to
thirty years ago the oyster industry had its beginning, and for a time
flourished. Almost all the available territory, both in the harbor and
in the Weweantit River, was granted. The older grants were leased
for fifteen years, and those of later date were arranged to run out at
the same time; so it followed that all the leases expired simultaneously,
and the industry came to an abrupt end. These old grants were not
renewed, for two reasons: first, they had not paid very well; and,
secondly, the growing quahaug industry promised more lucrative returns.
The scallops, too, began to be abundant, and the old oyster business
gave way before its newer and more prosperous competitors.</p>


<h3><i>Fall River District.</i></h3>

<p>The Fall River district, comprising the six towns of Fall River, Freetown,
Berkley, Dighton, Somerset and Swansea, may best be treated
as a geographical unit. The oyster industries of the individual communities
overlap to a considerable extent, and make distinct separation
difficult, while, as the same methods of culture everywhere obtain and
the same problems and difficulties are encountered, a brief survey of
this whole region may be comprehensively discussed in one article.</p>

<p>The beautiful shores of Mount Hope Bay and its tributary streams,
the Cole, Lee and Taunton rivers, furnish an extensive territory for
a large oyster industry. The best of this area is now included within
the confines of the bay itself, though the Cole and Lee rivers furnish a
small but valuable addition. The Taunton River, however, which thirty
years ago produced the finest oysters in the State, and was the main
source of supply for this district, has become utterly worthless for the
growth of marketable oysters. In fact, this river, with its curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
history, and the difficulties which it now presents to the carrying on
of an important and profitable industry, furnishes the most interesting
problem of this whole region. This river embraces the entire oyster
territory of Freetown, Berkley and Dighton and portions of Somerset
and Fall River,&mdash;certainly half of all the available territory of the
whole section; and yet it is an indisputable fact that this large and
formerly profitable area is now altogether unsuitable for the production
of edible shellfish.</p>

<p>The causes for this transformation of a river which once supplied
a large annual revenue to the prosperous communities which lined its
banks, into a stream unwholesome and unfit for the proper maturing
of its shellfish, have been much discussed. The prevailing opinion
seems to lay the blame to the impurities discharged into the river by
the Taunton factories. Other theories, ingenious but far less worthy
of weight, have been urged; but the burden of evidence strongly points
to the sewage of the city of Taunton as the probable main factor in
the decline of the industry.</p>

<p>While greatly impaired as a favorable territory for the propagation
of oysters, the river, however, is still largely utilized. Extensive grants
are sold by the towns of Dighton, Berkley and Freetown to oystermen,
who bed them with "seed," which is allowed to remain until it is from
two to three years old, when it is taken up and replanted in some other
locality where the waters are uncontaminated, and here left for a
certain time until it becomes "purified" and ready for shipment to
market. By this method the old grants are still worked, though greatly
declined in value, as oysters can no longer be sold to market direct,
and the process of transplanting entails considerable expense.</p>

<p>In the other towns of this region the industry is carried on much the
same as in Buzzards Bay or Barnstable. A great deal of attention is
paid to the enemies of the oyster, particularly the starfish. This animal
is combated chiefly with "mops" of cotton waste which are dragged
over the bottom, and the starfish, becoming entangled in the strands, are
removed and destroyed. As this fairly effectual warfare is being constantly
waged, the numbers of this pest are kept well reduced, and the
grounds maintained in very good condition.</p>

<p>By a peculiar local custom, which would be decidedly unpopular in
some coast communities, the towns of this section usually sell their
entire oyster privilege to some individual or company, ordinarily the
highest bidder. In this manner, aided by the fact that some persons
purchasing such rights re-sell them to others, the oyster industry of
this entire region is owned and controlled by a very few men. This
arrangement, however, does not seem to be unpopular, the only difficulty
arising from those clammers who are accustomed to dig clams under
water, and sometimes find a bed located on an oysterman's grant. In
such cases the owners usually waive their rights, and allow the clammers
to dig undisturbed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>As has been said, the oyster industry in this district, while it has by
no means attained its maximum development, has indeed reached very
considerable proportions. The entire amount of area granted aggregates
810 acres. Of this total, some 510 acres are suitable for oyster
culture, the remainder being soft mud, shifting sand, or otherwise unfit
for utilization. The entire output for 1907 exceeded 38,000 bushels,
valued at $26,250. Thirty-six men depend partially upon the business
for a livelihood.</p>

<h3><i>Nantucket.</i></h3>

<p>The oyster industry of Nantucket is of recent origin, and the oysters
are as yet raised only for home consumption.</p>

<p>Two grants have been leased by the selectmen, but only one of these
is now planted. These grants are situated in the east and west bends
of Polpis harbor. The cultivated grant in the west bend comprises
some 20 acres, only 3 of which are of hard bottom and suitable for
oyster culture, the remaining 17 having a soft mud bottom.</p>

<p>The "seed" planted on the grant is obtained at New Haven. In the
last few years the oysters on this grant have thrown a large quantity
of spawn, which has caught on piles and stones at various places around
Nantucket harbor.</p>

<p>The only enemy to the Nantucket oyster is the oyster drill.</p>

<p>The production of marketable oysters for 1906-07 was 200 bushels,
valued at $400. These were sold for home trade on the island.</p>

<p>One man is engaged in the oyster business for a period of three
months each year.</p>

<p>The oysters are taken both by dredging and with tongs.</p>

<h2><a name="Clam_Mya_arenaria" id="Clam_Mya_arenaria"><span class="smcap">Clam</span> (<i>Mya arenaria</i>).</a></h2>


<p><i>Mya arenaria</i>, commonly known as the "soft" or "long-neck" clam,
is found along the entire Massachusetts coast, wherever there is afforded
a sufficient shelter from the open ocean. Exposed beaches with open
surf are never inhabited by this mollusk, which is usually found on
the tide flats of bays, inlets and rivers, and on the sheltered beaches
between high and low tide lines. The clam occurs in various kinds of
soil, from rocky gravel to soft mud, but grows best in a tenacious soil
of mud and sand, where it lies buried at a depth of from 6 to 12 inches.</p>

<p>As Cape Cod marks the dividing line between a northern and a
southern fauna, it also divides the clam flats of Massachusetts into two
distinct areas. The same clam is found both north and south of Cape
Cod, but the natural conditions under which it lives are quite different.
In comparing these two areas, several points of difference are noted.</p>

<p>(1) The clam areas of the north coast are mostly large flats, while
those of the south shore are confined to a narrow shore strip, as Buzzards
Bay and the south side of Cape Cod for certain geological reasons
do not possess flats, but merely beaches.</p>

<p>(2) The rise and fall of the tide is much higher on the north shore,
thus giving an extent of available flats nearly six times the clam area
south of Cape Cod.</p>

<p>(3) Clam growth as a rule is much faster on the north shore. This
is due to the great amount of tide flow over the river flats of the north
shore. Current is the main essential for rapid clam growth, as it
transports the food. The average south shore flats possess merely the
rise and fall of the tide, and as a rule have not the currents of the north
shore rivers.</p>

<p>(4) The temperature of the northern waters is several degrees colder
than the waters south of Cape Cod. This affords, as has been shown
experimentally, a longer season of growth for the southern clam. The
north shore clam in the Essex region only increases the size of its shell
through the six summer months, while the south shore clam grows
slightly during the winter.</p>

<p>The present advantages lie wholly with the north shore district, as
through overdigging the less extensive areas of southern Massachusetts
have become in most parts commercially barren. Overdigging has not
occurred to the same extent on the north shore, owing to the vast extent
of the flats. Nevertheless, many acres of these, as at Plymouth,
Kingston, Duxbury, and even Gloucester and Essex, have become wholly
or partially unproductive. The only important clamming in Massachusetts
to-day is found in the towns bordering Ipswich Bay. The south
shore and a good part of the north shore furnish but few clams for
the market.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>In view of restocking the barren areas through cultural methods,
the north shore possesses two advantages over the south shore:
it has a larger natural supply at present, which will make restocking
easier; it has larger areas of flats, which can be made to produce
twenty times the normal yield of the south shore flats. Although,
compared with the north shore, the clam area of the south shore seems
poor, it is above the average when compared with the clam areas of the
other States south of Massachusetts, and when properly restocked the
clam flats of southern Massachusetts should furnish a large annual production.</p>

<p>If the clam industry is not properly cared for, it will be totally
ruined before many years. The clammers do not realize this, because
of a mistaken impression that nature will forever furnish them with
good clamming, and they have little thought for the future; while, on
the other hand, the consumer is indifferent from lack of knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Scope of the Report.</i>&mdash;The object of this report is to present in
brief form the condition of the clam fishery in Massachusetts. For this
purpose facts showing the present extent of the industry have been
compiled, with the view of furnishing both the clammer and consumer
with certain desirable information.</p>

<p>The report will consider: (1) general conditions of the industry of
1907; (2) a survey of the clam-producing area, illustrated by maps;
(3) a plan of clam culture which will make productive many acres of
barren flats; (4) the history of the clam industry, a comparison being
made between the industries of 1879 and 1907; (5) a description of the
industry.</p>

<p><i>Methods of Work.</i>&mdash;The same methods as used with the other shellfish
were pursued in obtaining the statistical data for the clam industry.
The clam-producing areas were examined and the observations recorded.
Town records, which were of some assistance with the other shellfish,
furnished practically no clam data, compelling the Commission to rely
upon the estimates of the clammers and clam dealers. While this
method made it difficult to secure accurate detailed information, the
statistics for each town were checked up in a variety of ways, thus
furnishing as nearly correct figures as can be obtained.</p>

<p>In making an historical comparison of 1879 and 1907, the report
of Ernest Ingersoll on the clam fishery of the United States, and the
report of A. Howard Clark on the fisheries of Massachusetts, as published
in the United States Fish Commission Report, Section V,
volume 2, and Section II., respectively, were of great use, as practically
all of the statistics for 1879 were obtained from these two reports.</p>

<p>In making the survey of the clam areas, records were made of:
(1) soil; (2) food (<i>a</i>) in water, (<i>b</i>) on surface of soil; (3) rate of
currents; (4) abundance of clams and localities of set; (5) barren flats
that can be made productive. In the present report only the kind of
soil, abundance of clams and area of barren flats will be given, the
food problem being reserved for later publication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Summary.</i>&mdash;In the following summary the seacoast towns are arranged
in geographical order from north to south. The number of
men includes both regular and intermittent clammers who dig for the
market; all others are excluded. In determining the production of
any town it is impossible to obtain exactly correct figures, as the amount
dug for home consumption is an unestimable quantity, and the clams
are marketed in a number of ways, rendering it almost impossible to
get complete statistics. The production statistics have been obtained
in a variety of ways, and the final estimates have resulted from careful
consideration of all facts. The invested capital includes the clammer's
outfit and boat, but does not include personal apparel, such as boots and

<p>The clam flats are divided into two main divisions: (1) productive;
and (2) barren. The barren areas are those where at present no clams
grow at all, not even scattering; and areas yielding even a few clams are
still considered productive flats, though to all practical purposes barren.
It was necessary to make the division thus, as otherwise no decisive line
could be drawn. The barren flats are divided into those sections that
can be made productive and those that can never be made to grow
clams. The productive flats, on the other hand, are divided into areas
of good clamming and areas of scattering clams which do not support
a commercial fishery. The normal production of the clam flats has been
carefully estimated, in view of the previous experiments of the Fish
and Game Commission, and the different classes of flats have each been
given a certain valuation in computing the total for each town. The
areas given of the clam flats are based upon calculations, as no engineering
survey was made.</p>

<p>The price of clams varies in different localities, and chiefly depends
upon the quality of clams and the method of marketing. In certain
towns clams are "shucked" (removed from the shell),&mdash;a process
which greatly increases their market value; while in other places they
are sold only in the shell. These two facts account for the apparent
variation in the value of the production in different localities, as each
town is given its own market price.</p>

<p>The following production table does not include an important factor,&mdash;the
amount of clams dug by the summer people. An unestimable
quantity is annually taken from the flats in this way, and is not
included in the production statistics. Indeed, summer people have
affected the clamming interests of several towns, as the selectmen have
refused to place closed seasons, etc., on certain depleted flats in order
to cater to the summer residents, who desire free clamming near their
cottages. The total number of licenses issued by the boards of health
of Boston and New Bedford for taking shellfish in their respective
harbors are given as representing the number of clammers. In reality,
however, only a few of these licensees make a regular business of
clamming.</p>

<p><i>Decline of the Natural Clam Supply.</i>&mdash;The decline of the clam
supply is a matter of general knowledge. People who live along the
seashore realize that they can no longer gather the amount of clams
they once could dig with ease from the same flats. On the southern
shore of the State especially it is oftentimes difficult to obtain even
enough for family use. The consumer also realizes the loss of the
clam, as he is forced to pay higher prices.</p>

<p>If specific cases of this decline are demanded, the following instances
should show the exact depletion in the various localities. Even in the
best clam-producing town of the State, Newburyport, where the clam
production, according to statistics, has apparently increased during
the last twenty-five years (as a result of more men entering the fishery),
the supply has shown signs of failing. Essex now possesses many
acres of flats formerly productive which now lie in a practically barren
condition. Gloucester can no longer boast of her former clam industry,
as the flats in Annisquam River are in poor condition. Hardly 30 men
now make a business of clamming in that town, whereas 92 men were
engaged in the fishery in 1879. Passing south of Gloucester, we find
great evidence of decline in the Boston harbor flats. Even before the
edict closing the harbor from clammers was in force, the production did
not by any means equal that of 1879. Plymouth harbor, including the
three towns of Duxbury, Kingston and Plymouth, furnishes an excellent
illustration of this decline. Here an area of flats as extensive as all
the other flats of the State combined now lies practically barren,
whereas in former times great quantities of clams were taken. These
flats had already become depleted to a marked extent by 1879, and to-day
practically no clams are shipped to market from the Duxbury flats,
although you can still read "Duxbury clams" on the menus of the
hotels and restaurants, showing how important a clam industry this
town once possessed. Buzzards Bay district lies at present unproductive
except for supplying home consumption and the demands of the
summer people. The shores of Cape Cod no longer yield their former
supply of clams, and the most striking example of the extinction of a
flourishing fishery is found in the town of Chatham, which now does not
produce one-tenth part of its production in 1879. The Fall River or
Narragansett Bay district does not come up to its past productiveness,
and now chiefly yields clams which in former times would have been
considered as too small to use.</p>

<p>As can be seen by the following table, which gives a comparison
between the industry in 1879 and 1907, the localities south of Gloucester
all show a decline in their production, and there is no town on
the coast which has not shown some depletion in the natural clam
supply. The localities of the north shore, while indicating by their
statistics a gain in production, nevertheless have not their former
abundance, and the actual diminution of the supply is concealed by the
fact that more men have entered the industry.</p>

<p><i>Causes of the Decline.</i>&mdash;The same cause which has been stated in
the general report has contributed to the decline of the clam supply,
<i>i.e.</i>, the increasing demand which has led to overfishing. Thus the decline
can be directly attributed to the exploiting of natural clam resources
by man, although it must be admitted that natural agencies, such as
geographical changes, destroy the clam flats of certain localities and
build up others.</p>

<p>This decline has become possible through the indifference of the towns
to the welfare of their clam fishery, and by not restricting, through
town laws, the extermination of the clams in time to allow nature to
replenish the flats. Some towns, such as Ipswich, have regulated this
matter by placing closed seasons on portions of the flats, which has
been the partial means of preserving their natural supply. Thus the
town laws have proved inadequate, as most towns have no laws at all,
or have such unwise ones that they often defeat their own object.</p>

<p>It is again necessary to emphasize the need of reform in the clam
industry. This Commonwealth once possessed an extensive supply of
clams, and still possesses part of its former abundance; but the present
supply is diminishing at such a rate that it will not be a quarter of a
century before the natural clam fishery will be commercially extinct.
On the south shore clams are now commercially extinct, and it is only
a question of time, if the present methods are allowed to remain, before
the north shore clams will also disappear. The experiments of the
Massachusetts department of fisheries and game and the work of men
who have planted this shellfish all show that thousands of dollars can
be brought into the State by utilizing the waste clam areas, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>the production can be so increased as to even exceed that of former
years. Immediate action is necessary, if this important industry is to
be saved.</p>

<p><i>The Remedy.</i>&mdash;The remedy is comparatively simple, and abundant
proof of its success is at hand. By restocking the barren and unproductive
areas of the Commonwealth the present production can be increased
many times. Experiments have shown that clams can be
readily, successfully and economically transplanted, and that it is
a completely practical undertaking. Not only can the barren areas be
restocked, but the yield of the productive areas can be much increased.
Clam farming is the only practical method of restocking these areas,
and only through such means can the clam flats be made to yield their
normal harvest.</p>


<h3><i>Clam Farming.</i></h3>

<p>The subject of clam farming has received a good deal of attention
the past few years, and much has been said concerning the enormous
profits which would result from the cultivation of this shellfish. While
the newspaper statements have been for the most part correct, there has
been considerable exaggeration and many details have been inaccurate.
To remove any misapprehensions, the following account of clam farming
is given.</p>

<p>The value of clam farming has been perhaps overestimated. While
no fabulous returns are ever to be expected, the yield is large in proportion
to the labor, and steady returns are sure. The methods used
are simple, the capital required is small, the area suitable for raising
clams is extensive, and clam farming gives promise of becoming one
of the most prominent and remunerative shore industries. The profits
derived from such a system should furnish steady employment for
hundreds of men on the Massachusetts coast.</p>

<p>Massachusetts possesses thousands of acres of tidal flats which are
capable of producing clams. Most of these flats are practically barren,
<i>i.e.</i>, produce no clams in paying quantities, and yet if planted with
small clams will yield in from one to two years large quantities of
marketable bivalves. This large area of barren flats should be divided
into small farms, which should be leased to individuals for the purpose
of planting and raising clams.</p>

<p><i>The Necessity of Clam Farming.</i>&mdash;It is a well-known fact that the
natural supply of clams is becoming rapidly exhausted, and that this
important fishery will become commercially extinct unless steps are
taken to check its decline. The only practical means known at the
present time is <i>clam farming</i>. In the past, methods such as close
seasons and restricting the catch have been used, but with poor results,
as these have been economically wrong. The correct method in such
cases is not to restrict the demand, but to increase the supply. Clam
farming offers the only means of increasing the natural production,
and not only checking the decline, but establishing a large industry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Is Clam Farming Practical?</i>&mdash;Clam farming is not a theory but
an <i>established fact</i>. Clams will grow if planted in suitable places,
and will yield large returns. For three years the Commission of
Fisheries and Game have made numerous experiments in clam farming
in many seacoast towns. They have not only proved its complete
practicability, but have also shown that large profits result from successful
planting. Records are on file at the State House showing the
exact results of these experimental farms, which indicate the future
success of clam farming.</p>

<p>Besides the experiments of the Commission on Fisheries and Game,
<i>successful clam farming</i> is now being carried on in several towns of the
State. The leading town in this line is Essex, where at least 15 grants
are held by the clammers. The only protection given is based upon
public sentiment, which, however, is sufficient to insure the success of
the enterprise. All these grants were staked out on flats which were
producing no clams when granted, although part of this area was once
very productive. So far these grants have proved most successful, thus
proving by actual experience that clam farming is a worthy rival of
agriculture.</p>

<p><i>Historical Attempts at Clam Farming.</i>&mdash;Clam farming has been in
existence for years. The first record of any legislation upon this subject
is found in an act to regulate the clam fishery in and around the
shores of Plymouth, Kingston and Duxbury in 1870, whereby a license
was granted for a term not exceeding five years to any inhabitant of
these towns to plant, cultivate and dig clams. This license cost $2.50,
and gave the exclusive use of the flats and creeks described to the
licensee and his heirs during the time specified, and also the right in an
action of tort to recover treble damages from any person who, without
his consent, dug or took clams from said grant. Evidently nothing was
done to follow out this law, which was soon forgotten.</p>

<p>In 1874 an act was passed to regulate the shellfisheries (including
clams) in the waters of Mount Hope Bay and its tributaries. The
terms of this act were practically the same as the Plymouth act, the
only difference being the substitution of the word <i>shellfish</i> for <i>clam</i>.</p>

<p>In 1888 an act was passed by the town of Winthrop, authorizing the
planting of clams on the shores of that town. The grant was to consist
of not over 2 acres of <i>barren</i> flats, situated more than 500 feet from
high-water mark. The other provisions of this act were the same as
those of the Plymouth act of 1870.</p>

<p>The most important clam culture law was passed in 1888. This
authorized the planting of clams on the shores of Essex. Here the
provisions of the law were followed out, and the first energetic attempt
at clam farming started. The law, the provisions of which were nearly
the same as the previous laws, reads as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the report of the United States Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries
for 1894 Mr. Ansley Hall gives the following account of clam
culture under this act:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>During the first two years (1889-90) the people were slow to avail themselves
of the privilege of planting, for fear that after they had spent their
time and labor they would not be able to secure protection from trespassers;
but in 1891 and 1892 lots were obtained and planted. In 1892 there were
25 acres that were quite productive, about one-third of the entire catch
of the section being obtained from them. The catch from these lots is
not definitely known, but is estimated at about 2,500 barrels.</p>

<p>Cultivated clams possess some advantage over the natural growth, from
the fact that they are more uniform in size, and are as large as the best
natural clam. They bring $1.75 per barrel, while the natural clams sell
for $1.50 per barrel. This is the price received by the diggers. One acre
of these clams is considered to be worth $1,000, if well seeded and favorably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
located so as not to be in danger of being submerged with sand. This
valuation would be too high for an average, since all the acres are not
equally well seeded and located. The clammers are generally impressed
that the industry can be extensively and profitably developed, and their
only fear is that they will not be able to secure lots permanently. The
greater part of the land available for this purpose is covered by the deeds
of people owning farms along the river, and the consent of the land owners
has to be obtained before lots can be taken up. It seems probable, however,
that the business will continue to progress unless checked by complications
that may arise relative to the occupancy of the grounds.</p></div>

<p>The result of this first practical attempt at clam culture was a
complete failure, and after a few years' trial the clam farms were all
given up. The main reason for this failure was lack of protection
both from outsiders and from one another. Nevertheless, this attempt
proved that with proper protection a most successful industry could be
made of clam farming. The following statement by Prof. James L.
Kellogg, in the United States Fish Commission Bulletin for 1899,
describes the failure of clam culture at Essex:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is not difficult to determine the reasons for the failure of the culture
experiment at Essex. The areas upon which clams were planted were those
which were at the time unproductive. The beds still containing clams&mdash;the
"town flats"&mdash;were free to any native of Essex. The one thing which
was absolutely necessary to the success of any planter was that the clams
on his leased ground should not be disturbed by other diggers. This protection
was apparently not given in any case by the town authorities, and,
as no person lived within sight of the majority of the beds, it was quite
impossible for any man to guard his property much of the time.</p>

<p>As to what followed it is not easy to obtain definite testimony from the
clammers themselves. Other citizens of the town, however, and some few
clammers, intimate that most of the men began to take clams from any
property but their own, and that in this way the full result of no man's
labor in planting was ever realized. Others who did not make clam digging
a regular business, but only dug occasionally, are said to have had no
respect for the rights of those who had leased property. It was said that
at times when vessel builders and the shoe factory released employees, many
of them, for lack of other occupation, turned their attention to clam digging,
with the result that too many clams were at the time taken from
the flats.</p>

<p>Another reason for the failure of the Essex experiment is that a number
of short-sighted clammers began to fear, after the clams had been planted,
that the production might suddenly become so great as to glut their market,
and, as a consequence, force prices down. Some few individuals, inspired
by this fear, are reported to have said and to have done everything
in their power to prevent the success of the experiment. In all cases, it
is said, the selectmen of the town, who issued the leases, refused their aid
in the prosecution of trespassers.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact, which had been demonstrated in the experiment,
that when properly planted the clams grew much more rapidly and became
much larger than on the natural beds, no applications for a renewal of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
leases were made when the first ones expired. No change in the condition
at Essex may be hoped for until there is some evidence that a law protecting
the planter will be strictly enforced. With proper protection, a
great industry might, and probably would, be quickly established, not
only in Essex, but in any region where clam flats are now unproductive
because of excessive digging.</p></div>

<p><i>Protection Necessary.</i>&mdash;The same lack of protection which ruined
the Essex clam experiments has been the cause of similar failures in
other shore towns. As long as no protection is given, clam farming can
never become possible, as the whole success of the enterprise depends
wholly upon the planter's having complete control of his land. The
present law gives absolutely no protection, as according to the old free
beach law a person has a right to dig a mess of clams anywhere
between the tide lines, no matter whether natural or planted. This
practically discourages clam farming, however profitable, as no clammer
is going to the labor and expense of planting clams, if the next person
who comes along has a legal right to dig as many as he pleases. Until
a law is passed which gives to the clam planter absolute protection from
this sort of trespassing, and does away with the antiquated free fishing
law, clam culture can never become a successful industry.</p>

<p><i>Present Clam Culture.</i>&mdash;In 1906 grants of barren flats were again
issued for the purpose of clam culture in Essex, and this time the
attempt seemed successful. Two things encouraged this: the excellent
results of the experiments in Essex River by the Commission on Fisheries
and Game, and the possible results indicated by the experiments of
1888. The only protection for these clam grants is by public sentiment,
and the mutual agreement of all the clammers to respect the rights of the
individual. So far there has been no trouble from trespassing and the
lack of protection, which caused the failure of first attempts. It is
hoped that these clam farms will become permanently successful, despite
the lack of protection, as they will greatly increase the production of
the Essex clam flats.</p>

<p><i>Clam Farming and Agriculture.</i>&mdash;The comparison between clam
farming and agriculture is very close, and both possess many common
features, though there are several points of difference. The clam obtains
its sustenance entirely from the water, while agricultural products
obtain their nourishment chiefly from the soil. The nitrogenous waste
products of the land washed into the streams furnish the nourishment
to the little marine plants (diatoms) on which the clams feed.</p>

<p><i>Rate of Growth of the Clam.</i>&mdash;The report of the Commission on
Fisheries and Game for the year 1906 contains the following statements:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>What is the natural growth of the clam per year?</i></p>

<p>There is great diversity in the growth of the clam, owing to the location
in respect to three essential conditions,&mdash;current, length of time submerged,
and soil. The following figures give briefly the general trend of results<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
from numerous experimental beds under great variety of conditions. For
simplicity, a 1-inch clam is taken as the standard.</p>

<p>A 1-inch clam will grow in one year to a size between 2 and 3 inches.
Under fairly favorable conditions, with a moderate current, a 1-inch clam
will increase to 2&frac12; inches, or a gain of 900 per cent, in volume. For
every quart planted, the yield in one year will be 9 quarts. For beds without
current, 1-inch clams average about 2 inches, or a gain of 500 per cent.;
<i>i.e.</i>, five quarts for every quart planted. Beds under exceptionally fine conditions
have shown the amazing return of 15 quarts for every quart of
1-inch clams planted. Clams increased in these beds from 1 to 3 inches
in length. Therefore, by planting clams 1 inch or over, under <i>favorable</i>
conditions a <i>marketable</i> clam can be produced in <i>one year</i>.</p>

<p><i>What is the maximum production per square foot?</i></p>

<p>The number of clams per square foot that can be raised to the best
advantage depends upon the location of the flat in respect to natural conditions.
Clams thickly planted (15 to 20 per square foot) in favorable
locations may show a greater growth than when thinly planted (5 per
square foot) in less favorable locations; therefore, no definite statement
can be made which will apply in all cases. The only rule that can be
given is that a flat with a current will produce a greater number of clams
per square foot than one without a current. On good flats clams can be
planted conveniently and economically from 10 to 15 per square foot, or
even a larger number.</p>

<p><i>What results can be obtained by planting on barren flats?</i></p>

<p>There are two groups of flats which come under the term barren: (1)
flats which once produced clams in great numbers, but now are practically
barren, except for an occasional clam here and there; (2) flats which never
have produced clams, and on which for physical reasons clams can never
grow. The first group of flats is alone considered in this answer.</p>

<p>Experimental beds were planted on certain flats in the Essex River which
come within the first group of barren flats. These once productive flats
had been cleaned out in the past, and for some reason had not seeded
naturally. Forty beds were laid out under all kinds of conditions, with
the object of finding a way to make these once more productive. Results
have been all that could be hoped for. Only 4 poor beds were found, out
of the 40 laid out; 36 beds were in thriving condition. It should be noted
that no attempt was made to choose the best places, but all conditions were
tried. Over two-thirds of the clams were re-dug, the increase averaging,
in terms of 1-inch clams, over 1,000 per cent., or 10 quarts for every quart
planted the year before.</p>

<p>If many acres of Massachusetts flat, idle at present, are capable of
such a yield, should such economic waste be allowed? Why should not
the towns, by the expenditure of a little money, restock flats such as these
for the benefit of their inhabitants? I do not say that all flats can be made
productive in this way, as I know of many cases where the mere sowing
of seed clams will not restock a flat; but I do say that Massachusetts possesses
enough flats of the former nature, which should be made a profit
to her clammers. Clam set occurs, as Mr. Stevenson shows in his report,
in large quantities; the transportation of seed clams is easy; planting requires
little labor, the practical way being to sow the clams, which burrow
readily; while the yield in proportion to the labor is enormous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p><i>What sized clams are best for planting?</i></p>

<p>The size best adapted must be determined for each flat. Shore flats with
little current will allow the planting of any size, from &frac14; inch up; flats
with a swift current necessitate a larger clam (1 to 1&frac12; inches), as the
smaller will be washed out of its burrow; soft mud also demands a larger
clam, as the smaller will be stifled by the oozy silt.</p>

<p><i>What are the physical conditions that influence the growth of clams?</i></p>

<p>There appear at least three essential conditions for rapid growth of clams:
(1) a good current; (2) low and level flat; and (3) a tenacious soil, relatively
free from decaying matter.</p>

<p>A low flat gives the clams longer feeding periods, as the water remains
over them longer, therefore there is a greater growth. This has been experimentally
shown by Dr. A. D. Mead.</p>

<p>According to Prof. J. L. Kellogg, clams cannot do well in a soil which
contains much decaying organic matter, as the acids eat away the shells.
Soils of this description also facilitate the spread of infection from one
clam to another.</p>

<p>Current is the chief essential for successful clam culture. The term
"current" does not imply a rapid flow of water, but rather a good circulation
of water over the flat. In the Essex and Ipswich rivers the clam flats
have a continuous current. On such flats the growth is more rapid than
on flats which have no circulation of water, in addition to the mere rise
and fall of the tide. The current performs the work of (1) keeping the
flats clean and carrying away all contamination, but its most important
work is as (2) <i>food carrier</i>.</p>

<p><i>Value of a Clam Farm.</i>&mdash;The value of an acre of clam flats, if
properly cultivated, is about $450 per year for the average clam flat.
Many of the more productive flats will yield a far greater amount,
while others will not yield as much. It has been often erroneously
stated that an acre of clam flats would produce $1,000 per year. This
is a decided overestimation, as it would be hardly possible for the most
productive flat to yield that amount. It is possible, however, for a
good flat to yield about $750 per year, but this is only under the most
favorable conditions. Such yields as these are large for the clammer,
whose average yearly income is only $400 (a few of the more expert
clammers make possibly $700 to $750), and a man possessing a clam
farm of 1&frac12; to 2 acres would make a good living.</p>

<p><i>Method of operating a Clam Farm: choosing the Ground.</i>&mdash;In
choosing a grant, the planter should have in mind three things: (1) the
accessibility of the grant, for his own convenience, and nearness to
the market, as much of the success of clam farming depends upon the
expense of marketing the product, and the ease with which it can be
disposed of; (2) the length of time allowed for labor by the exposure
of the flat (flats vary greatly in the amount of time exposed each tide,
the low flats being submerged nearly all the time, and the high flats
having a much longer exposure),&mdash;a high flat possesses the advantage
of allowing a longer working period for the clammer; (3) the natural
facilities of the flat itself as regards the growth of clams. Moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
the flat should be chosen in regard to (1) soil; (2) current; (3) tide.
A good flat should have a soil which is tenacious and compact, affording
at the same time easy digging. Probably the best soil is a mixture of
fine sand and mud in a ratio of one-third mud to two-thirds sand, as this
amount of mud gives the right degree of tenacity.</p>

<p>The growth of a clam depends upon the circulation of water over the
flat, as the current carries the food, and, therefore, the more current
the more food for the clams. Current also keeps the bed clean, and
prevents contamination and disease from spreading among the clams.
Then, again, the growth of a clam depends upon the amount of water
over the bed; <i>i.e.</i>, length of time covered. The clam can only feed when
the tide is over the bed, and thus the feeding time is limited for the
higher flats. While experiments have shown that clams grow faster
when continually under water than when exposed part of the time, the
question of tide is not so great a factor as that of current in regard to
clam growth, and can be almost disregarded.</p>

<p>The best flat for clam planting is a <i>fairly high flat</i> with a <i>good current</i>
over it, as it gives nearly as rapid growth and a much longer period
to dig than a flat which is exposed only a short period. This flat must
have the right kind of soil, which must not be shifting sand or too soft
mud, but a compact, tenacious mixture.</p>

<p><i>The Seed Clams.</i>&mdash;Nature has provided the means of stocking these
farms. The set of clams is usually restricted to certain localities,
which, however, vary from time to time, and heavy sets are found in
limited areas. These sets run as thick as 2,000 per square foot of
surface, occasionally covering an area of 3 acres. From these natural
set areas the natural clam flats are partially restocked by the washing
out of the small clams. More often these whole sets are wasted,
as the clams, instead of washing on the good flats, are carried to unproductive
places and consequently perish. Thus there are areas of
heavy set which are of no use to any one, as practically all the clams
perish before they become adults. These areas of heavy set occur in
nearly every harbor of the coast to a greater or less extent, and are
available for nearly every town.</p>

<p>The problem now is to make use of these large sets, and not allow
them to go to waste. It has been shown that these clams when transplanted
will grow much faster, and will not perish; therefore, clam
farming offers both the possibility of saving these natural sets and
utilizing barren ground.</p>

<p>Methods of spat collecting have been constantly referred to in connection
with clam farming, especially by the Rhode Island Fish Commission,
and the impression has been given that clam farming can
never become a success until some practical method of spat collecting
has been found. With the soft clam there is no need of any method
of spat collecting, as the natural set is more than sufficient for restocking
the barren flats. All that is necessary is to utilize the enormous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>natural sets. If this is done, the barren flats of Massachusetts can be
made productive.</p>

<p>The main difficulty is in devising some method of obtaining the small
clams with sufficient rapidity. As the nature of the soil and the size of
the clams vary, no one method can apply to every case, and it depends
upon the ingenuity of the clammer. The methods used at present are:
(1) digging with an ordinary clam hoe, which is slow work; (2) digging
in shallow water, so that the clams may be washed out; (3) digging
a series of trenches across the heavy set area, and scooping out the
clams washed in these trenches; (4) carrying both sand and clams by
the dory load; (5) by using a sieve, in the form of a cradle, which
washes the clams out in the water. This last method is the most successful
for small clams, and has been used by the commission in obtaining
seed clams for their experimental beds. By using a cradle 3 by 2
feet, covered with sand wire netting, clams which ran 3,000 per quart,
were obtained by 3 men at the rate of 2 bushels an hour,&mdash;an amount
sufficient to plant from 1/25 to 1/10 of an acre.</p>

<p>Another problem of importance is the transportation of seed clams,
as in many instances the clams will have to be carried some distance.
The best method of shipping seed clams is to pack them dry in damp sea
weed, putting them in small packages, so they will not be crushed by
their own weight. The best though most expensive method is to pack
the clams in crates, such as are used for strawberries. It has been
found that clams kept in water are not in such good condition as those
shipped dry, and it is of the utmost importance that the clams be in
good condition when planted.</p>

<p>The length of time a clam will live out of its natural element depends
upon the temperature; in cold weather it will keep for several days,
and even weeks; while in warm weather the seed clam will be in poor
condition after one day's exposure.</p>

<p><i>Preparing the Grant.</i>&mdash;Usually the ground needs no preparation,
and the clams can be planted at once. It is a good plan to remove any
mussels and any of the enemies of the clam from the grant.</p>

<p><i>Planting the Clams.</i>&mdash;The planting of the seed clams is perhaps the
easiest work of the clam culturist, as it necessitates merely the sowing
of the seed on the surface of the flat. The small clams when left this
way burrow into the ground as soon as the water is over them, and
require no planting on the part of the culturist.</p>

<p><i>Working the Farm.</i>&mdash;This style of farming requires no cultivation
for the growth of the clams. Once planted, the farmer has no further
work until the time when he is ready to dig them. The clams grow
better when undisturbed than when the soil is upturned by frequent
digging. Protection from man and the natural enemies of the clam
demand the attention of the owner at all times.</p>

<p><i>Harvesting the Clams.</i>&mdash;The time of digging will vary as to the
size of clam desired and the rate of growth on the grant. The clam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
farmer can cater to a particular trade by regulating the size of the
clams marketed. He may find it more profitable to market a small
clam after a short period of growth, or <i>vice versa</i>, on the same principle
that a farmer raises hogs for the market.</p>

<p>North of Boston, in localities favorable for fast growth, such as the
Essex and Ipswich rivers, by planting large seed of at least l&frac12; inches
in the spring, marketable clams of 2&frac12; to 3 inches can be obtained in the
fall after six months' growth. Here the clams grow only during the
summer months, and nothing would be gained by leaving them over
winter. In this way a crop each year can be raised on these farms.
In other localities of slower growth it will take from eighteen to twenty-four
months to raise a crop. The clam farmer will have to regulate
the size of the seed and length of growth to best suit the needs of his
farm.</p>

<p><i>Advantages of Clam Farming.</i>&mdash;Clam culture possesses several advantages
over the old free-for-all digging: (1) steadier returns; (2)
easier work; (3) better pay; (4) more clams per man. If the clammers
of the Commonwealth only realized these facts they would make a
united effort toward clam culture.</p>


<h3><i>History.</i></h3>

<p>I. <i>Early History.</i>&mdash;The history of the Massachusetts clam industry
began in obscurity. Even before the time of the earliest settlers the
native Indians depended largely upon this abundant mollusk for their
food supply, as is clearly indicated by the scattered shell heaps which
mark their ancient camp fires. Upon the arrival of the Pilgrims, clam
digging was incorporated among the most time-honored industries of
the Commonwealth, and in times of want the early colonists depended
largely upon this natural food supply. With the arrival of the colonists
really began the first epoch of the clam fishery as an economic factor
in this Commonwealth, a period which lasted nearly two hundred years.
This period marked the exploitation of clam grounds merely for home
consumption. Money was scarce, inland markets were practically unknown,
and the importance of this shellfish was confined merely to local
quarters.</p>

<p>II. <i>Rise of the Bait Industry.</i>&mdash;Early in the last century a growing
demand for clams as bait for the sea fisheries became apparent. Clams
had always been utilized for this purpose more or less, but an increased
demand called for the development of an important industry in this
line. Various centers of activity were established, particularly at Newburyport,
Essex, Ipswich, Boston harbor and Chatham. The clams
were mainly shucked, that is, removed from the shell, and shipped either
fresh or salted in barrels to the fishermen at Gloucester, Boston and
Provincetown. This industry opened up new fields of employment for
many men and boys, and brought considerable ready money into various
coast communities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>III. <i>The Development of Inland Markets.</i>&mdash;The consumption of
clams for food in the coast towns continued throughout the rise and
gradual decline of the bait industry, but the creation of inland markets
did not begin to be an important factor until 1875. It was about this
time that the clam came to be generally looked upon throughout the
State as an article of food, and consequently an important industry
was gradually evolved to meet this growing demand. This step marked
the beginning of the extensive fishery of the present day.</p>

<p>The mistaken policy of the average shellfish community, which
regarded clam grounds as natural gardens of inexhaustible fertility,
still persisted even after the fallacy of this policy had long proved
apparent through the depletion of extensive tracts. The same ill-advised
methods were pursued to the ultimate ruination of much valuable
territory. All wise regard for the future was overshadowed by the
immediate needs of the present; local legislation fostered the evil; State
legislation was conspicuous by its absence; and, left to the mercy of
unsystematic overdigging, these natural resources rapidly wasted away.</p>

<p>The disastrous tendencies which have lurked in the ruling policy of
the clam fishery have been shown in the rise and fall of the industry in
certain localities. Forty years ago Duxbury and Plymouth ranked as
the greatest clam towns of the coast. Their supply has long since
become insignificant. Newburyport and Ipswich have become the chief
producers of the State clam harvest; but Essex and Gloucester, in the
same fertile regions, have greatly declined, and the industry at Rowley
has become nearly extinct. In the Fall River district the digging of
small seed clams for food has brought the fishery to the verge of ruin.
The few resources of Buzzards Bay have become nearly exhausted,
while on Cape Cod the industry has shown here and there a temporary
increase, overshadowed by a far more extensive decline, such as at
Chatham. Furthermore, the sewage contamination of coast waters in
the harbors of Boston and several other large cities have closed extensive
regions for the production of food.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Attempts to develop the Industry.</i>&mdash;Various efforts have been
made to restrain overdigging the clam flats, by local regulations, particularly
by "close" seasons. These attempts have been productive of
little good. Other efforts, designed to develop extensive tracts made
barren by wasteful methods of fishing, have been put in operation.
These efforts have been along two independent lines: the first, an effort
on the part of the community to seed in common flats by the appropriation
of money for that purpose, as in the case of Wellfleet; the
second, an attempt to arrive at the same end by leasing private grants
to individuals, as at Essex and Plymouth. These efforts, while tending
in the right direction, have not as yet yielded the results that might
be wished for. Within the past three years the State has taken hold
of the problem, and by an extensive series of experiments is endeavoring
to devise practical means of developing the great inherent possibilities
in this extensive industry.</p>

<h3><i>The Clam Industry.</i></h3>

<p><i>Methods of Digging.</i>&mdash;The ordinary method of taking clams is so
simple as hardly to need explanation. Although simple, clam digging
requires considerable skill, and it takes years of experience to become
a good clammer.</p>

<p>There are two methods of clam digging used in Massachusetts,&mdash;the
"wet" and the "dry" digging. Wet digging is carried on when
water is over the clam beds; dry digging, which is the common method,
takes place when the flats are left exposed by the tides. The only
places in Massachusetts where wet digging is carried on regularly are
Eastham, Chatham, Swansea, and in Katama Bay, Edgartown. In
the lower end of Katama Bay is found a submerged bed of clams
which is one of the most productive beds of this class in Massachusetts.
These submerged clams are taken with what is known locally as a "sea
horse," which is an enlarged clam hoe, with prongs 12 to 14 inches
long, and a strong wooden handle four feet in length. This handle
has a belt attachment which is buckled around the clammer. Two men
are required for this work. The sea horse is worked deep into the loose
sand and is dragged along by one man, who wades in the shallow water
over these submerged flats, while his partner follows, gathering the
clams which the sea horse roots out. Another method of wet digging is
called "churning," and is based on the same principle as the above
method, only the clams are turned out under water by long forks or
hoes. This method is not used in Massachusetts to any extent. Excellent
results are usually obtained from wet digging.</p>

<p>The methods used in dry digging depend upon the nature of the soil.
The difference lies only in the kind of digger. The clam hoe of the
south shore, where the soil is either coarse sand or gravel, has broad
prongs, some even being 1&frac14; inches across. The usual number of prongs
is four, but occasionally three broad prongs suffice. The clam hoe of
the north shore, often called "hooker," has four thin, sharp prongs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
and a short handle. The set of this handle is a matter of choice with
the individual clammers, some preferring a sharp, acute angle, and
others a right angle. This style of clam hoe is best suited for the hard,
tenacious clam flats of the north shore. At Essex spading forks are
used for clamming, but not as extensively as the hooker. For sand
digging the forks are said to be better, while for mud digging the
hooker is preferred.</p>

<p><i>Outfit of a Clammer.</i>&mdash;The outfit of a clammer does not require
much outlay of capital. A skiff or dory, one or two clam hoes and three
or four clam baskets complete the list. Occasionally, as at Ipswich,
where the clam grounds are widely scattered, power dories are used,
and this necessitates the investment of considerable capital; but the
investment of the average clammer does not exceed $26. Personal
apparel, such as oilskins and boots, are not considered under this head.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clamming Outfit.</span>

<p>The boats most often used by the north shore clammers are called
"skiff dories," and in construction are between a dory and a skiff.
These boats are especially adapted for use in rivers.</p>

<p><i>Marketing.</i>&mdash;Clams are shipped to market either in the shell or
"shucked out." Two rules are followed by the clammers in making
this distinction: (1) small clams, or "steamers," are shipped in the
shell, especially during the summer months, while the large clams are
"shucked;" (2) the fine-appearing sand clam is usually sold in the
shell, while the unprepossessing mud clam is shucked, <i>i.e.</i>, the shell
and the external covering of the siphon or neck are removed. This
causes on the north shore a division by locality. The Ipswich and
Essex clams, except for a few individual orders, are mostly shipped to
market in the shell, while the Annisquam River and Newburyport
clams are usually shucked in the winter. Little if any shucking is done
by the south shore clammers.</p>

<p>Shucking almost doubles the value, as a bushel of clams, worth in the
shell 75 cents, will furnish, when soaked, about 10 quarts of shucked
clams, which bring about 50 cents per gallon, or a total of $1.25 when
marketed. The shucked clams are put through a process of soaking in
the same way the scallop "eyes" are treated before marketing. They
absorb a sufficient quantity of fresh water, after soaking six hours, to
increase their bulk about one-third and give a plump appearance to
the clams.</p>

<p>While many clammers do not soak their clams, it seems to be a
universal tendency, wherever clams are shucked, to gain by this method.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Soaking of any sort impairs the flavor of the clam, and for this reason
such a practice is to be deplored, but as long as the consumer is satisfied
to take second-rate goods, this practice will continue, and it can
be stopped only by the united demand of the shellfish dealers.</p>

<p><i>Shipment.</i>&mdash;Second-hand flour and sugar barrels are used for the
shipment of clams in the shell, while kegs and butter tubs hold the
shucked clams. In winter clams can be shipped inland without perishing;
but in hot weather they will spoil in a few days, unless iced.</p>

<p><i>Maine Clams.</i>&mdash;Massachusetts annually consumes many thousand
barrels of Maine clams. If the demand of the Boston market were
not partially met by the influx of Maine clams, the clam flats of Massachusetts
would be subject to a greater drain.</p>

<p><i>Market.</i>&mdash;The principal market for the clam industry of Massachusetts
is Boston. Gloucester, Newburyport, Salem and Lynn draw part
of the clam trade of the north shore, but the greater portion goes to
Boston, whence it is distributed throughout the State. In recent years
shipments have been made from the Ipswich Bay region direct to New
York, Baltimore and Philadelphia.</p>

<p><i>Price.</i>&mdash;The price of clams is fairly constant, varying but little in
summer and winter. Naturally, this seems curious, when winter and
summer clamming are compared. The production in winter is much
smaller than in summer, which is due to (1) fewer clammers, because
of the severe work in cold weather; (2) less working days, as the
clammer is often unable to dig for weeks, and even months, and also
cannot work early or late tides, as in summer. In spite of this diminution
of supply, the winter price is practically no higher. This is due to
a smaller demand in winter, as well as to the influx of the Maine clams
at this season. In summer there is an increased demand for clams,
caused by the arrival of the summer people at the seashore; and large
quantities of this shellfish are used by hotels, cottages, etc. This increase
in demand is enough to offset the increase in supply, resulting in a stationary
price.</p>

<p>The price varies as to the quality of the clams, whether soaked or
unsoaked, small or large, good or poor looking shells, and fresh or stale.
The average price as received by the clammer for clams in the shell is
75 cents per bushel; shucked clams, when soaked, 45-50 cents per
gallon.</p>


<h3><i>Arrangement of Towns.</i></h3>

<p>Owing to the peculiarities of the different localities, it has been
impossible to satisfactorily arrange the towns alphabetically. Therefore,
in order to present local comparisons, they have been arranged in
geographical order, starting at the northern boundary of the State.</p>


<h3><i>Salisbury.</i></h3>

<p>Salisbury, the most northerly town in the State, has a good clam
territory, very similar to that of Newburyport, though much smaller
in area.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>Almost all the clam ground, and practically all the very good digging,
is comprised in a single flat, which extends along the northerly bank of
the Merrimac for nearly 2 miles. This flat is about 900 feet wide, on
an average, and has a total area of 216 acres. On the eastern end, and
skirting the channel, it is sandy; but for the most part it is mud
throughout, varying from a hard, smooth surface in the middle portion
to a soft, scummy soil on the west.</p>

<p>About 100 acres in the central section of this flat are covered with
a thick set of clams, especially from 1 to 2 inches. This territory
furnishes the bulk of the good digging, and is being constantly turned
over and the larger clams sorted out. Roughly speaking, the main east
half of the flat is sandy, or hard mud, with very good clamming, the
western half softer mud, with fair or scattering clams. This is an
exceptionally fine natural clam flat, and if properly cultivated its production
would be immensely increased. At the eastern extremity of
the flat a long, narrow cove extends in a general northerly direction
into the main land. This cove, including the outer fringing bars,
contains some 34 acres of flats, for the most part sandy and rather
poorly productive, though no considerable area is anywhere strictly
barren. The combined clam flat territory of the town aggregates 250
acres, comprising 150 acres of good clamming and 100 acres of scattering
clams; of these, 216 acres are of mud and 34 acres of sand.</p>

<p>While the town records show 66 licensed clammers, only about 50
make clamming their chief occupation. The industry is carried on in
much the same manner as at Newburyport; $625 is invested in boats and
implements, and some 15,000 bushels of clams, aggregating $16,500,
are annually produced.</p>

<p>The clam industry at Salisbury is largely stationary as regards
available territory, while the production varies considerably from year
to year. There is little or no town legislation affecting the industry,
except the issuing of permits by the selectmen. These permits cost 25
cents, and are required from every clammer.</p>

<h3><i>Newburyport.</i></h3>

<p>Newburyport is pre-eminently the clam town of Massachusetts. It
produces the most clams, gives employment to the most men, and has
on the whole the finest flats.</p>

<p>The total clam-growing area of this town comprises about 1,080 acres;
of this, some 800 acres are more or less productive, while the balance,
280 acres, is practically nonproductive. Scattering clams exist everywhere,
so there are, properly speaking, no truly barren flats.</p>

<p>The flats of Newburyport, broad, level and continuous, are peculiarly
adapted to clam culture. The general type of soil is mud, varying from
a soft, sticky variety on the west coast, and also along the shores of
Plum Island, to a firm, hard surface in the great middle section north of
Woodbridge's Island, where clams flourish most abundantly and furnish
the best digging within the city limits. Here nearly 100 acres are
covered with a heavy set of 1 to 2 inch clams. Altogether there are
some 930 acres of this mud. Much of this, especially to the west and
south, is apparently unfavorable to clams, being soft and unwholesome,
but even here at certain seasons clams are dug extensively.</p>

<p>The sand flats include the shifting Hump sands that fringe the
Merrimac channel and the Cove on Plum Island. These and other
minor sections comprise about 150 acres. The Hump sands are quite
productive. The other sand flats are not entirely barren, but practically
unutilized.</p>

<p>The clam industry at Newburyport furnishes employment for about
175 men, although over 200 depend upon it for some portion of their
income. The season lasts the year round, though on account of storms
and ice the winter's work is rather uncertain. A good fisherman will,
under favorable circumstances, dig several bushels of clams at a tide,
though the ordinary man will probably not average more than a bushel
and a half, taking the whole year into account.</p>

<p>The outlay of capital invested is comparatively small. A flat-bottom
boat or dory, a clam hoe or two, and three or four wire-bottom baskets,
constitute a clammer's outfit, costing altogether perhaps $15 or $20. As
two or more men frequently go in one boat, even this expenditure may
be reduced. The shore property in use, consisting of from 8 to 10
shanties, is also inconsiderable. Several power boats are used, however,
and their added cost brings the aggregate money invested up to about
$2,700.</p>

<p>The flats of Newburyport are a large factor in its economic wealth.
During 1907 they produced nearly 55,500 bushels of clams, exceeding
$61,000 in value. Nearly two-thirds of these clams were shucked, that
is, removed from the shell and sold by the gallon. In this form, usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
soaked to increase their volume, they retail for about 45 cents per
gallon. As clams in the shell, sold for "steamers," etc., will hardly
bring more than 65 cents per bushel, the process of shucking nearly
doubles the value to the fisherman, as a bushel of clams in the shell will
produce from 2 to 3 gallons of soaked clams. The income of the
average clammer will hardly exceed $350 per year, but a really energetic
and industrious fisherman may in the same time make from $500
to $700, or even more. Many of the men have individual orders from
dealers in Lynn, Haverhill and the neighboring cities, while the local
dealers ship largely to Boston.</p>

<p>The regulation of the industry by city ordinance is of very little
note. Practically the only legislation pertaining to it is the law which
requires every clammer to have a permit, but even this regulation is but
indifferently enforced. The Newbury flats are likewise free to the Newburyport
clammers, and part of the Newburyport production comes
from these outside flats.</p>

<p>The history of the clam industry at Newburyport is one of constant
change. Twenty years ago large areas on southwest Joppa were practically
barren; now they are quite productive. The reverse is true of
Ball's flat on Plum Island, which, though once of great importance, is
now almost waste. Though no serious inroads have as yet been made,
a slow but steady decline in the industry is distinctly noticeable.</p>

<h3><i>Newbury.</i></h3>

<p>The town of Newbury has in itself no shellfish industry, although
there is an extensive area of suitable flats which are worked with equal
rights by the Newburyport clammers. These flats comprise some 360
acres, and extend along both sides of Plum Island Sound and Parker
River. Over 100 acres of scattering clams occur, though not in sufficient
quantities for the most part to make very profitable digging. The
remainder, some 260 acres, though almost all suitable for the production
of large quantities of clams, is practically barren.</p>

<p>The principal type of soil is mud, and the mud flats comprise about
250 acres. The flats of Parker River and those in its immediate neighborhood,
however, are largely sand, and altogether they aggregate about
110 acres. Of these, "the thoroughfare" is practically the only one
which furnishes clams in any quantity. Sections of the broad flats
which border on Plum Island Sound produce scattering clams of large
size. There is, however, no very good digging in town, and no consistent
effort seems ever to have been made to utilize the great wealth
which lies dormant in the clam flat territory. Six Newbury men dig
intermittently in the summer, and furnish some 300 bushels, worth
about $250, for town trade. However, this does not take into consideration
the amount taken from these flats by the Newburyport
clammers.</p>

<h3><i>Rowley.</i></h3>

<p>Rowley presents a more striking example of the decline in the shellfish
industry than any other town in this region.</p>

<p>Four hundred acres of good flats border Plum Island and Rowley
River within the town limits, but of these only 20 at most are economically
productive. Eighty acres more are not entirely barren, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
practically worthless, while the remaining 300, though almost all well
adapted for clam culture, are barren.</p>

<p>The main type of soil is sand, and the sand flats, for the most part
in Plum Island Sound, comprise some 250 acres. The remainder, 150
acres, is mostly mud in scattered sections along the Rowley River and
in patches on the main flats. The only really productive flats are the
little coves and creeks of Rowley River and the Knob Reefs in Plum
Island Sound. The Knob Reef clam grounds produce very large and
fine clams, which lie on the lower edge of the flat and are exposed only
a short time every tide. Knob Reefs also has the distinction of possessing
probably the finest clam set of its size in the State, which would
furnish abundant opportunity for restocking all the barren Rowley
River flats, if the town authorities had taken proper measures to transplant
this seed. As it is, this extensive set, too thick for good growth,
is rapidly wasting away.</p>

<p>The history of the industry is one of steady decline. Reliable evidence
exists to show that almost all the flats of Rowley once produced clams,
and that large areas now waste were formerly productive. That these
immense barren areas, possessing such an enormous latent wealth, should
be allowed to remain thus unimproved, is a most conclusive argument
for the need of radical action. No settled attempt, however, except for
a single closed season in 1906, has ever been made by the clammers
or town authorities to better the conditions, or to check the decline in
the productive territory that remains.</p>

<h3><i>Ipswich.</i></h3>

<p>Ipswich is second only to Newburyport in the production of clams,
and has perhaps even greater possibilities of development. The clam
territory of the two towns, while nearly equal in extent, is, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
markedly different in general characteristics. The flats of Newburyport,
while few in number, are broad, continuous, and have a great degree
of similarity throughout. The flats of Ipswich, on the other hand,
are divided into a great number of relatively small sections, widely
diversified in character, and scattered along an extensive coast line. As
these flats are in many respects the most interesting and important of
any town in the State, it seems well to examine them in detail.</p>

<p>Four distinct divisions can be distinguished in the clam territory of
this town: Ipswich River, Plum Island, Green's Creek and Roger
Island, and Essex River flats.</p>

<p>Taken in the order named, the Ipswich River has in itself a great
variety of clam ground. Both sides of the river for nearly 3 miles are
fringed with bars, mainly of mud though sandy near the mouth. Some
of the mud flats are so soft that they are practically barren, or given
up largely to mussel beds; while much of the sand, as, <i>e.g.</i>, the main
portion of the High Sands, is too shifting to be valuable. The larger
part of these river flats are, however, productive.</p>

<p>The Plum Island division comprises Lufkins, Point Peter, Appletons,
Foresides and several other minor flats. Of these, Lufkins is very
important. It occupies a semicircular depression on the coast of Plum
Island, and, owing to its peculiar location, the swift current which
flows past its outer edge makes a double eddy at both ebb and flood
tide. These eddies sweep gently over its broad surface, and deposit
a fine silt which has made the characteristic soil a hard, bluish clay.
This is the only important clay flat of this region. The total area of
Lufkins is 46 acres. The outer border to the north is mud, becoming
soft; to the south, sandy. The portion near shore is, as has been stated,
a clayey soil, and it is here that clams are found abundantly. An exceptionally
good set of 1 to 2 inch clams occupies from 3 to 4 acres
of this portion. Though clams are numerous, the exceeding hardness
of the soil makes digging rather difficult.</p>

<p>Point Peter, or "P'int" Peter, is also an important flat, comprising
altogether 28 acres, though about 7 acres of the outer portion extend
far into the current, and are of so shifting and sandy a nature as to
be practically worthless. Most of the remainder is mud, varying from
sand and hard mud on the outside to soft mud in the creeks that lead
into the main land. The central portion of the flat is peculiarly
adapted to the culture of clams, however, and is very productive.</p>

<p>Appleton's flat comprises about 6 acres of hard sand, verging into
mud, thickly strewn with old clam shells. It lies at the mouth of
Perkins and Pine Creeks, which run for about a mile into the main
land of Plum Island, and contain nearly 25 acres each of fairly productive
mud flats. Appleton's is a valuable flat, and the clams dug
here are large.</p>

<p>The Foresides is a thatch island a little over a mile in length, lying
in the mid channel of Plum Island Sound. The flats which surround it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
on all sides are practically all sand, and comprise about 80 acres. The
whole western side is more or less productive, though the outer edge,
where the strong cross currents of the channel sweep over, is too much
rippled to be suitable for clam growth. The strip of sand along the
northern and northeastern sides, though rather narrow and limited in
area, is productive, while most of the southeastern portion, which
projects far into the channel, is barren and totally unadapted for soft
clams, though bedded with sea clams. The productive sections of this
flat are much dug, and altogether it is one of the most important of the
Ipswich clam grounds.</p>

<p>The west coast of Plum Island Sound, comprising the Green's Creek
and Roger Island territories, extends from the Ipswich to the Rowley
rivers. This division contains the bulk of the waste and barren flats
of the town, although there is exceptionally good clamming in Stacy's
Creek, Third Creek and the "Nutfield."</p>

<p>The Essex River region is rather remote for most of the clammers,
and hard to reach, but furnishes on the whole some of the very best
digging. The three main flats of this division are the Essex beach,
Wheeler's, and the Spit. Essex beach has a very good set, evenly
sprinkled over the ridgy, shifting bars that skirt the channel.</p>

<p>Wheeler's is an irregular sand bar, occupying about 77 acres. Fully
one-half of this is very productive, and in the main portion occurs
another thick set very similar to that on Essex beach.</p>

<p>The Spit, mainly sand or sandy mud, lies in the three towns of
Ipswich, Essex and Gloucester. The whole area is some 300 acres,
about a third lying within the town of Ipswich. This whole bar is
so liable to change that any calculations based on its precise area or
location are decidedly unreliable. Very good digging occurs, however,
in limited areas on the north and west sides of the Ipswich territory.</p>

<p>These four divisions comprise the clamming territory of Ipswich, and
aggregate 970 acres, of which 390 acres is sand and 500 mud. This also
includes 15 acres of mussels scattered along Ipswich River, Plum
Island and Green's Creek region, and about 10 acres of eel grass in
various localities. Over 800 acres is more or less productive, about half
being good clamming.</p>

<p>About 50 regular clammers depend upon these flats for a living,
though 136 permits were issued in 1907. Here, owing to the greater
distances to be traversed, many power boats are used. Nearly $7,500
is invested in the industry, and 25,000 bushels of clams, at a valuation
of $18,750, are annually produced. The relative decrease in price as
compared with Newburyport is due to the fact that shucking is not so
extensively practised here.</p>

<p>The town laws merely require a permit from every clammer, for
which no charge is made. Such permit is issued at the discretion of
the selectmen, and requires of the recipient six months' residence in
the town and two years in the State. In past years the town has made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
several by-laws for the protection of shellfish, chiefly in the nature of
partial closed seasons; but unfortunately considerable difficulty has
been found in enforcing these excellent laws, and the results have been
far from satisfactory.</p>

<p>Ipswich has jealously guarded the rights of its clam flats, and has
protected them in every way from the invasion of outsiders, which in
part accounts for the excellent condition of these flats, which were
originally deeded to the Commoners by the Crown, and from them to
the town. Ipswich is the only town in the Commonwealth which has
thus directly received its clam flats as its own property, and naturally
has done more to improve its natural clam resources than any other
town in the State.</p>

<p>The history of the industry shows little change; some few flats once
considered worthless have been opened and utilized; others once productive
have been dug out and allowed to become waste. On the whole,
the industry is following the trend of the shellfisheries everywhere, and
slowly but steadily declining.</p>

<h3><i>Essex.</i></h3>

<p>Essex, while still ranking as an important clam-producing town, has
a very imperfect development of her shellfish resources. The total
clam flat area comprises some 650 acres, and, though scarcely more than
25 acres can be considered as unfit for the growth of clams, and consequently
barren, only a little more than half the remainder is at all
productive, and of this probably less than 150 acres yields any financial
return. In other words, 325 acres of good clam flat is allowed to remain
practically barren.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>The main type of soil is sand, and nearly 500 acres may be properly
classed under this head. The remaining 150 acres are mud, and are
located in the creeks along the river and in the coves north of Hog
Island. The productive sections are scattered for the most part along
both sides of the Essex River, and well-developed areas are also
found at its mouth and on the Spit. There are several good locations
of seed clams. One section of about 25 acres occurs on the west side
of the Spit. This is composed of 1 to 2 inch clams, running 10 to 40
per square foot. At the mouth of the river on the north side occurs
another set of &frac12;-inch clams, covering about 10 acres. On the flats
west of Cross Island is found a third set of &frac12; to 2 inch clams, comprising
about 30 acres. Other smaller patches of set are scattered
along the river almost up to its source.</p>

<p>About 50 men derive an income from these flats. Some $1,200 is
invested, and the annual product exceeds 15,000 bushels, valued at
$12,750.</p>

<p>The town of Essex has realized the importance of the clam problem,
and has attempted through legislation to deal with it. The selectmen
are empowered to grant to citizens of the town an area consisting of
an acre or less on flats already barren, for the purpose of raising
clams, and in this manner partially restock the flats. A rental of
$2 is charged, covering a period of five years, and an additional fee
of 50 cents is required for recording. In spite of inadequate protection,
the experiment has been conducted long enough to prove that
these flats can be made profitable to the clammers.</p>

<p>The history of the clam industry at Essex is one of extensive decline.
There is every reason to believe that the greater part at least of the
waste area was once very productive. Prof. James L. Kellogg in the
United States Fish Commission Bulletin for 1899, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We have much evidence that the clam industry in Essex has, in the past,
been extensive.... Much more testimony of a similar character may be
had to show that the flats once very productive have almost entirely failed.</p></div>

<h3><i>Gloucester.</i></h3>

<p>The far-celebrated deep sea fisheries of Gloucester overshadow her
humble shellfish industry; but within her tidal flats lie undeveloped
resources, which if properly brought out would form no inconsiderable
factor in her annual revenue. Even now her clam fishery attains considerable
proportions, though by no means what it once was, or what
it might be were suitable cultural methods employed.</p>

<p>The main areas of clam-producing territory lie in the Annisquam
River and in the Essex River in West Gloucester. The grounds in the
Annisquam are the more productive. This river is some 4 miles long,
and is bordered for the greater part of this distance with tidal flats. Of
these the sand flats predominate, though there are large areas of mud
and extensive beds of mussels. On the extreme head of the river, known
as the Dumfudgeon region, dredging operations for the Gloucester
canal have somewhat impaired the flats, but as a whole the river seems
in every way suitable for the production of an abundant harvest of
clams.</p>

<p>The flats of West Gloucester, including a portion of the Essex Spit,
are largely unproductive. The Spit is the only flat of any extent in this
region which is at present of real economic value; the remaining flats,
scattered along the south shore of the Essex River and its tributary
creeks, are for the most part practically barren.</p>

<p>The total area of clam flats in Gloucester approximates 550 acres. Of
this, some 250 acres are sand, 200 mud, while there are about 100 acres
of mussels and eel grass, which cannot be considered at all adapted for
clam culture. Only a fraction of the whole, 75 acres, more or less, is
good clamming; a scant 100 acres produces scattering clams; 275 acres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
are barren, though capable of producing clams; while 100 acres may
never be made productive.</p>

<p>Eight men dig regularly on these flats the year round, and 23 others
work intermittently. The capital invested amounts to over $600, and
the annual output exceeds 6,000 bushels, valued at $8,000. Most of
the clams produced at Gloucester are shucked either for market or bait.</p>

<p>Local legislation has no bearing on the shellfish question, and no
effort is being made either to better conditions in the clam industry or
to check its steady decline.</p>

<p>The industry has fallen off greatly in the past few years. In 1875
there were 90 regular clammers, and a man could dig 6 bushels to a
tide, where now 8 regular and 23 intermittent clammers find it difficult
to get from 1&frac12; bushels to 3 bushels per tide.</p>

<h3><i>Manchester.</i></h3>

<p>Manchester has a coast line so much exposed, and consequently so
small a territory of tidal flats, that it is not surprising to find its clam
industry of very insignificant proportions. Affairs are in much the
same state of apathy as at Beverly, though Manchester does not possess
the resources of the former town, and could not, in the nature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
case, carry on any extensive clam business. Its facilities, however, poor
as they are, are very imperfectly utilized; hence the present state of
depletion, verging on absolute exhaustion.</p>

<h3><i>Beverly.</i></h3>

<p>Beverly has practically no clam industry. The area of tidal flats,
comprising nearly 50 acres, is at present unprofitable and nearly
worthless. As at Swampscott, some clams still continue to be dug for
bait and for local clam bakes, but any evidence of a systematic business
has long ceased to exist. Thirty years ago clams were far more
abundant, though there was never an extensive industry. The town
authorities require no licenses and make no efforts to revive the industry.</p>

<h3><i>Salem.</i></h3>

<p>Salem has far better natural advantages for clam culture than the
other towns in its immediate vicinity, and leads in clam production,
though the industry is of very inferior proportions. Seven men are at
present employed in digging the harbor flats, where the clams have
very recently seeded in. Many of these clams, though rather small,
are shucked, and the remainder are sold in the local markets. The
entire value of the annual production does not exceed $200, and the
capital invested amounts to but $75. This is rather poor showing for
100 acres of flats for the most part comparatively good, and capable
of yielding $11,000 annually. The Salem clammers dig also in the
Danvers River in the town of Danvers.</p>

<h3><i>Lynn.</i></h3>

<p>The city of Lynn has within its tidal flats the latent resources of an
important industry. Its clam grounds could, if properly utilized, yield
a great increase over their present inconsiderable return. No legislation
on the part of the city authorities has intervened to improve the shellfish
production or to prevent the depletion of valuable territory which has
been allowed to gradually lapse into an unsanitary desert. While at
low tide about 400 acres of flats spread over the broad harbor or border
the banks of the Saugus River, but 40 acres of this wide expanse yield
any appreciable revenue. The principal part of the digging is done
on the mud flats of the Saugus River. Here 7 fishermen work intermittently
to supply the local market during the summer months. There
is some good territory at the mouth of the river toward the north, and
scattering clams occur along the eastern shores, but the main flats of
the harbor are for the most part barren.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>The deposit of sewage from the city drainage has undoubtedly had a
prejudicial effect on much of this area, as the unpleasing scum which
covers the soft, sticky mud and eel grass bears abundant witness.
Whether measures undertaken to reclaim this lost area would in the
long run yield profitable returns is an undecided question, but much
might be done, by the employment of judicious cultural methods, to
increase the yield of those flats which are properly productive. No
exact returns of the annual clam harvest for this region are obtainable,
as most of the output is disposed of at retail, but it cannot exceed 1,000
bushels, and probably falls far short of that figure; $1,000, then, or
thereabouts, represents the total monetary income from this fishery.</p>

<h3><i>Saugus.</i></h3>

<p>At Saugus conditions in many respects parallel those at Lynn. The
clam grounds, while they by no means equal those of the neighboring
city in area, are on the whole better, as they are freer from contaminating
sewage. Of the 250 acres which comprise the normal tide flat
area, only 100 acres, or 40 per cent., can be said to be strictly barren.
The remaining 150 acres is an undeveloped asset, as its value lies far
more in its prospects than in its present productivity. While scattering
clams occur throughout, no more than 25 acres can be accounted paying
property. This remunerative territory lies chiefly in the Saugus River
and in the vicinity of the Point of Pines. Here 10 men dig quite
regularly, particularly in the summer, though none of them depend
wholly upon this source of revenue for a livelihood. The annual output
equals that of Lynn, both in amount and valuation. To these flats,
with their undeveloped resources, local legislation gives practically no
attention.</p>

<h3><i>Nahant.</i></h3>

<p>Although Nahant has a large area of tidal flats, it is not on the whole
favorably located, and much that would otherwise be available is necessarily
waste. The territory which borders the western coast is not
barren, but most of it is not productive enough to be profitable.</p>

<p>A few scattered sections repay the clammer for his labor, and from
these sections perhaps 300 bushels a year are dug for home consumption.
Four or five men are employed at intervals in the summer
months, but no one of them depends upon this source of income for
more than transient employment, as the entire value of the yearly
harvest does not exceed $300. As there are nearly 250 acres of flats
in Nahant, this would be a revenue of $1.60 per acre, on an average.
However, this is not a fair comparison, for much of the territory
apparently available is, as has been stated, properly waste. Nevertheless,
an industry of far greater proportions than at present could
be attained if wise legislation were directed to that end.</p>

<h3><i>Boston Harbor.</i></h3>

<p>Owing to the danger arising from sewage contamination the State
Board of Health, on Dec. 6, 1906, requested the Department of Fisheries
and Game to prohibit the digging of clams for market in Boston harbor.
The region closed by this law lies to the west of an imaginary line running
from Point Shirley through Deer Island to the northeastern end
of Peddocks Island; thence in a southwesterly direction to the extreme
point of Hough's Neck. This territory includes Winthrop, Chelsea,
Charlestown, Everett, Somerville, Cambridge, Boston, East Boston,
South Boston, Dorchester, Neponset and Quincy. For convenience all
the prescribed territory is treated under the head of "Boston harbor."</p>

<p>The action of the State Board of Health in closing Boston harbor
was necessitated by a due regard for the public health, as it seemed
inexpedient to allow clams dug from this territory and subject to
sewage contamination to be marketed for food. Necessary as this act
may have been, the closing of 5,000 acres of flats for the production of
edible shellfish made valueless an important source of revenue, and
threw a large number of clammers out of employment. Some alleviation
of these conditions has resulted through the granting of permits
to take shellfish for bait from the prescribed waters, thus furnishing
a number of men with transient employment. The value of the law,
however, is almost completely nullified, for the danger to the public
health is actual, and not imaginary. Under present conditions it is
well-nigh impossible to make the necessary surveillance so complete as
would be necessary to prove that clams "dug for bait" are not used
as food. Further, even in the digging and handling of shellfish in
polluted waters there is positive danger of transmitting the germs by
hands of the digger to his own mouth or to other persons.</p>

<p>The nature of the flats permit the division of Boston harbor into
three sections: (1) the north shore, (2) the south shore, (3) and the
islands.</p>

<p>(1) The northern coast of the harbor has extensive mud and sand
flats, covered for the most part with eel grass or scattered mussel beds.
Much of the surface is a variety of pebbly gravel, while but little of
it appears to be good clam ground. The mud flats are mostly covered
with a sewage scum which renders them unsuitable for clams. Scattering
clams are found throughout the entire region.</p>

<p>The immediate vicinity of Snake Island in Winthrop and the cove
on Point Shirley furnish fairly good clamming, while clams are found
in a greater or less degree upon the extensive flats of Winthrop harbor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
The flats of the Mystic River, which are of a tenacious mud rather
unwholesome in appearance, in so far as they have not been encroached
upon for building purposes, possess scattered patches of very good
digging, and furnish transient employment to 20 or more men. The
flats in the Charles and Chelsea rivers likewise furnish fair clamming.</p>

<p>(2) The south shore of the harbor is much like the north, except that
the mud type of soil predominates. The large flats, mainly mud, are
not entirely barren though most of the clams are found in a narrow
strip of beach along the shore. At South Boston as well as in Dorchester
Bay clams are found in considerable numbers, though nowhere
are there any large areas of good clamming.</p>

<p>(3) The islands in the harbor are fringed with pebbly beach, where
scattering clams are usually found. Apple Island and Governor's
Island are surrounded with quite extensive flats, which are, however,
but sparsely productive. Much digging for bait is carried on constantly
on these pebbly beaches.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Boston harbor has been in the past a good clamming
region, as the magnitude of its available flats has rendered possible
an extensive production. Naturally, the closing of the harbor by the
State Board of Health has limited the annual production of clams
from this vicinity, as now the only legal digging is for bait. Owing
to this partial closed season the clams are said to have been on the
increase during the last two years. Nevertheless, before the passage
of this act the fishery had already greatly declined. The decline of
the clam industry has been going on for years, as even in 1879 Mr.
Ernest Ingersoll mentions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In Boston harbor clams are much depleted, owing to the fact that they
are remorselessly dug the year through, chiefly by a class of ignorant
foreigners who go down the harbor for the purpose. July and August are
the most productive months, there being a large demand for the "clam
bakes" which picnic parties from the cities indulge in on the various
beaches. All the clams got in Boston harbor are very small, because they
are allowed little chance to grow; in March and April they are hardly
worth eating.</p></div>

<h3><i>Weymouth.</i></h3>

<p>Weymouth, with its two rivers, possesses an area of flats aggregating
250 acres. The shores of Fore River are stony, but in spite of the hard
digging clams are found in fair numbers. The shores of Back River
are similar, except for the mud flats on the channel, which are either
barren or but sparsely productive. A few clams are dug for bait and
home consumption.</p>

<h3><i>Hingham.</i></h3>

<p>Hingham has an area of tidal flats comprising nearly 650 acres. The
characteristic soil is of two kinds: a marginal strip of pebbly beach
extending the full length of the shore, and the broad flats of Hingham
harbor and Weir River, with their extensive areas of mud, eel grass
and mussels. The clamming territory is confined for the most part
to this narrow strip fringing the shore, though scattering clams are
found in diminished numbers on the mud flats.</p>

<p>The shellfish industry of the town consists mostly in procuring clams,
mussels and cockles for bait. Clams are dug to some extent for home
consumption and for the hotels at Nantasket; but the fishery is carried
on in a desultory manner by a few men who dig when other work fails,
and who do not wholly depend on clamming for a livelihood.</p>

<h3><i>Hull.</i></h3>

<p>The stony shores of Hull offer but little suitable clam area, though
fair digging is found in the vicinity of Hog Island and in Weir River.
The usual type of flat is a pebbly or gravel beach, while near White
Head and Weir River there are large mud areas. Clams are dug only
for home consumption or for bait.</p>

<h3><i>Cohasset.</i></h3>

<p>Cohasset, though possessing sufficient suitable area to support a
clam fishery, has no industry of any importance. The greater part
of the tidal flats are barren, while the remainder are far from fertile.
The region immediately about White Head and the territory opposite
extending along Barson's beach are the most productive, while scattering
clams are found in Little Harbor.</p>

<p>The total acreage of available flat exceeds 100 acres. Of this, 90
acres are wholly unproductive, and the remainder, 10 acres, is not very
valuable. The main type of soil is sand, though areas of mud are found
in the coves. There are no regular clammers, though many clams are
dug by the citizens of the town for their own use. There has never
been a clam industry worthy of the name at Cohasset, and the present
state of apathy appears to be normal. No local regulations of any
kind govern the fishery.</p>

<h3><i>Scituate.</i></h3>

<p>There is no clam industry at Scituate. The selectmen of the town
have forbidden all exportation of clams for market, and consequently
the few clams dug are utilized for home consumption.</p>

<p>The possibilities of a future clam industry at this town, while not
alluring, give indications of some promise. Occasional clams are found
on the shores of Scituate harbor, as well as its tributary creeks. The
main undeveloped resource lies, however, along the broad flats of the
North River. These flats undoubtedly constitute a considerable asset
in the communal wealth, and the action of the selectmen in maintaining
a close season will tend to the restocking and consequent utilization
of this territory.</p>

<h3><i>Marshfield.</i></h3>

<p>Affairs at Marshfield are in practically the same state of inactivity
as at Scituate. The town has considerable natural advantages, since
the North River, which formerly made a wide sweep to the south before
emptying into the ocean, has opened a new channel within the
last ten years, forming many acres of excellent clam ground. A close
season is maintained, although there has been considerable discontent
on the part of certain individuals relative to this policy of the selectmen.
A considerable quantity of clams, probably not exceeding 200
bushels per annum, are dug for home consumption. There are no shipments
for market.</p>

<h3><i>Duxbury.</i></h3>

<p>The clam industry at Duxbury has a peculiar interest, owing to the
many perplexing problems which it presents. A vast extent of tidal
flats, far exceeding in area those of any other town in the State, and
in a measure suitable for the production of clams, lie almost wholly
barren. The enormous territory comprised in these flats exceeds 3,500
acres, or, roughly, 5&frac12; square miles. This is greater than the combined
clam area of Salisbury, Newburyport, Ipswich, Essex and Gloucester,
which is the finest territory in the State, and produces most of the
Massachusetts clams. Duxbury, with a greater area than all these towns,
dug in 1907 about 700 bushels of clams,&mdash;an amount which could well
have been produced from 2 acres of ground. An investigation into the
history of the town shows us that this state of barrenness has not always
existed. There was a time when Duxbury was justly celebrated for
her shellfish, as is still shown by the allusions to Duxbury clams on
the menus of many hotels and restaurants. The dealers at Taunton,
Fall River and other Massachusetts cities formerly sent to Duxbury
large orders for clams, which were always forthcoming. Now, as far
as can be ascertained, not a single barrel is shipped out of the town
from year to year.</p>

<p>This transition from a state of prosperity to one of almost total
barrenness is replete with interest, and is difficult of solution. Doubtless
several causes may have contributed to this general decline. In the
first place, it is evident that the Duxbury flats were never in so flourishing
a state of production as those of the Cape Ann district. This
assumption is amply supported by historical records, and it is also
supplemented, at least, by the fact that a great per cent. of the
present territory is largely unfit for the production of clams in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
quantity. As these flats have changed scarcely at all for many years,
is it unreasonable to suppose that they ever have been very suitable
since the first settlement of the country?</p>

<p>As for the historical records referred to, the weight of evidence
everywhere tends to prove that many years ago there was a fairly
large output of clams yearly from Duxbury. But while this output was
large in itself, it was, in proportion to the possible area, exceedingly
small. Mr. Ernest Ingersoll states that in 1879 there were yearly
exported from Duxbury 5,000 bushels of clams. At that time, he
says, the industry had declined. Clamming was then prosecuted with
no such vigor as at the present time, for the price was low, and the
demand, except for bait, by no means excessive. Clams had not yet
come to be looked on as such important articles of food as at present,
and the business of digging them as carried on then could have made
little inroad on well-stocked flats. The great probability is that only
a small percentage of the whole territory was ever very productive.
An observer at the present time, viewing from an eminence the flats of
Duxbury at low tide, could not help being struck with the singular
appearance which they present. He would see spread out before him
a broad expanse apparently of green meadows, with long, narrow
streams of water winding in and out among them. These seeming
meadows, stretching on mile after mile, broken here and there by a
patch of clear sand, are the tidal flats of Duxbury, more than 2,700
acres of which are covered with a thick growth of eel grass.</p>

<p>How many years this eel grass has covered the flats no one knows.
It shifts somewhat, as the ice in winter sometimes plows up an immense
surface, stripping it of its green covering. For the most part it seems
to grow steadily year after year, until the roots, decaying stalks and the
fine sediment which they have collected build up a spongy crust over the
true bed of the flat. It is this spongy, clayey soil which is the predominant
type in the eel-grass region, though a large area is soft mud
with little patches of hard sand. It does not seem surprising that clams
are not abundant in this soggy medium, covered with its thick matting
of grass. Clams do exist, however, for occasionally when the ice in
the winter storms has scraped bare a section of these flats, scattering
large clams can be found.</p>

<p>Whether anything can be done with these eel-grass flats on a sufficiently
large scale to render the undertaking profitable, and whether
they would prove good ground for clam culture if the eel grass were
removed, is a problem. However, the sand flats free from eel grass
comprise nearly 800 acres,&mdash;an area sufficient in itself to furnish a
very large industry for the town. Smooth, hard and unshifting, they
have the appearance of being in every way suitable for the production
of an enormous amount of shellfish. Yet, barring cockles, mussels and
razor clams, shellfish are rare on most of these flats, which, in spite
of their inviting appearance, are practically barren.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>The only places where clams are dug in any quantity is along the
shore. Here little scattered patches, remnants perhaps of the former
large supply, repay the clammer's toil with a scant return. Little or
no effort is made to dig them on the main flats, and few are so dug
unless they happen to be unearthed by accident when the men are
searching for razor clams for bait. The supply is hardly adequate
for home consumption and the demands for bait by local fishermen.</p>

<p>Whether all the great tidal territory of Duxbury can ever be reconstructed
into profitable clam ground is a difficult question. There exist,
however, no known reasons why a fishery at least as flourishing as that
of twenty years ago could not be re-established and indefinitely developed.
A great industry was once in evidence here. Outside the boggy
eel-grass marshes (doubtful territory at best) are wide expanses of
clean sand flats, suitable in every way for the cultivation of clams.
That the ingenuity of man properly administered can build up an
enormous industry on these sand flats alone, no thoughtful person can
doubt, and then utilization of these great barren Duxbury wastes will
partially, at least, be accomplished.</p>

<h3><i>Kingston.</i></h3>

<p>The condition of the clam industry at Kingston is in many respects
parallel to that at Duxbury. The clam flat area (some 600 acres) is
very much smaller, but the character of the soil is essentially the same,
consisting for the most part of clay, soft mud and eel-grass marshes,
with a relatively small proportion of really suitable ground.</p>

<p>The two main flats of the town are Egobert's and Gray's. Egobert's,
the larger of the two, has an area of about 275 acres. Most of this is
practically waste, owing to a thick growth of eel grass; but a triangular
piece on the mid-southern section is bare. This portion of smooth,
unshifting sand comprises about 80 acres. A few patches of clams
are scattered along the outer edge, near the channel, but hardly any of
these patches produce clams enough to make it profitable to dig them.
The great bulk of this territory is entirely barren.</p>

<p>Gray's flat is of an entirely different type. It is a long flat, with a
fairly uniform width of about 100 yards. It runs through its entire
length parallel to the shore, while on the other side it is separated
from Egobert's by a 300-foot channel. Like Egobert's, it is covered
for the most part by eel grass, but it is essentially different in the
nature of its soil, which is mud throughout. Although the total area
of the flat is about 115 acres, an irregular section of bare mud on the
southeastern side, comprising 30 acres, is the only available clam territory.
This section is composed of soft mud on the north and south,
rather poorly suited for clam culture; but the mid section contains
several acres of hard mud, which seems well adapted, and here clams
are found in sufficient quantities to keep several men digging intermittently
through the summer months.</p>

<p>Along the shore a few clam grants have been given to individuals
by the local authorities. These are managed with fair success, though
no business other than that of supplying the local demand is carried
on. The possibilities of forming a clam industry here of importance
is evident, though through lack of available territory it could never
give promise of such a development as might be looked for from Duxbury
or Plymouth.</p>

<h3><i>Plymouth.</i></h3>

<p>The clam industry at Plymouth is at a low ebb. The same problems
which baffle progress at Duxbury and Kingston are present here with
all their complications. The combined available territory, exceeding
1,600 acres, save for a few unimportant sections, is wholly barren.
While it is true that fully two-thirds of this great area is eel-grass
waste, and in its present state of little value for the production of
clams, there remains over 500 acres of good flats, for the most part
sand well adapted for shellfish culture. It is certain that a flourishing
industry has existed here in former times. From the earliest history
of the colony, records tell of the excellent clam flats at Plymouth; and
we learn that the Pilgrims during the darkest hours of the early settlement
depended in large measure upon these flats for support. As late
as 1879 Ernest Ingersoll reports an annual output of 5,000 bushels of
clams, and states that the industry had then greatly declined. It
appears to have gone down steadily ever since, until now it merely
furnishes transient employment to 4 or 5 men, who dig at rather uncertain
intervals for local markets.</p>

<p>The best clamming, probably because the most inaccessible, is around
Clark's Island. Scattering clams occur on Wind flat, the Oyster grant,
and in patches along the shore. But no considerable extent of good
clamming occurs anywhere, and the bulk of the territory is wholly
barren.</p>

<p>The town of Plymouth has endeavored in several ways to develop
the industry. It has appropriated money to restock the flats, a close
season has been tried, and an attempt made to solve the problem by the
giving of private grants. While these grants have not always been
run in as energetic a manner as could be desired, the experiment has
proved conclusively that there are great possibilities in such a system.
In short, there can be little doubt that in the proper administration of
private grants lies the key to the solution of the problem which confronts
this whole region. As clams were once abundant in Plymouth
harbor, and as no apparent causes other than excessive digging appear
to have brought about the decline, there seems to be no logical reason
why this amount of territory (500 acres) should not yield its proper
harvest. As for the vast extent of eel-grass flats, with all their undetermined
possibilities, they can well afford to wait until the more immediate
and pressing problems of the flats already available for clam
culture have been solved.</p>

<h3><i>Barnstable.</i></h3>

<p>The clam industry at Barnstable, while not so extensive as at Ipswich
or Essex, is nevertheless of special interest. The immensely long coast
line, stretching for many miles on both the north and south shores of
Cape Cod, gives the town a shellfish area both in Cape Cod Bay and
Vineyard Sound which renders it unrivalled throughout the State for
variety of marine life and diversity of natural environment. These
conditions, as they affect clam culture, are best suited on the northern
or bay side of the town, where the clam industry flourishes more extensively,
as the southern shore is almost wholly given up to the rival
quahaug, oyster and scallop fisheries.</p>

<p>On the northern shore a large harbor, nearly 5 miles long and about
2 miles broad at its widest part, extends in a general westerly direction,
ending in a vast waste of salt marshes interwoven with a network of
creeks. Up this harbor the tides rush with great velocity, and when
they sweep out to sea leave a broad expanse of flats, sandy on the
north and central portions and muddy on the south. These flats cover
an aggregate area of 400 acres, comprising 200 acres of hard sand and
150 acres of soft mud. Large stretches of these mud flats on the south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
are waste, and covered for the most part with eel grass. Other sections
elsewhere are likewise waste for various causes, and are to be excluded
as unprofitable or barren; yet the total available area remaining after
making these deductions exceeds 350 acres. This is the theoretical condition,&mdash;the
real condition is far otherwise: 20 acres at the most
yield clams, and of these only 10 acres produce them in marketable
quantities.</p>

<p>The explanation of these conditions is interesting. In the winter
the ice and the force of storms tear out great pieces of the tough marsh
surf, and the tides sweep them down the harbor. Some of these huge
masses are torn to pieces and washed away, others find lodgment on the
broad surface of some tidal flat; these, becoming stationary, accumulate
sediment; the grass grows upon them through the summer, and gradually
a little island is formed. Surrounding these islands and oftentimes
growing over their entire surface, bedded in among the roots of
the marsh grass, we find a very thick set of clams. In short, all the
digging of any kind is in the immediate vicinity of these islands.</p>

<p>The deductions to be made from these facts are apparently simple.
In the spawning season, when the microscopic clam larv&aelig; are in their
floating stage, they are carried here and there by the currents. Later,
when they tend normally to settle in some fertile tract of flat, they are
prevented from so doing by reason of the remarkable swiftness of the
tides, which sweep strongly over the broad, smooth flats, and give
the little clams no opportunity of lodgment. Only in the firm thatch of
low-lying islands can they find anything to cling to, and here, with
their slender byssus threads attached to unyielding grass or roots, they
are able to withstand the wash of the current. Thus the clams are
gathered in great numbers in these natural collectors, later are washed
on the neighboring flat, and finally a little colony grows up about every
island of this sort.</p>

<p>That this is actually what happens is largely borne out both by
observation and facts. It makes little difference where these islands
are located; clams grow nearby, while all about may stretch smooth,
hard flats, perfectly adapted for clams, yet altogether barren. In view
of the somewhat incomplete investigations made in this region, it is perhaps
too sweeping to point out any single factor as the sole cause for
these waste areas; but undoubtedly the swift tides and smooth, hard flats,
which offer no resting place for the young larv&aelig;, constitute the main
causes.</p>

<p>Another odd circumstance in connection with the Barnstable clam industry
is the local regulations which control the industry. Almost all
digging is carried on in the winter, as a local by-law forbids the digging
of clams in summer in any quantity exceeding 6 bushels per week for
family use. This somewhat curious by-law is designed wholly for the
benefit of the majority of the clammers, and to give them employment
in that season of the year when work is most difficult to obtain. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
interfering somewhat with summer clam bakes, the law appears to meet
the approval of the townspeople.</p>

<p>The south shore of Barnstable possesses many of the features of
Buzzards Bay, and produces clams only in numbers sufficient for home
consumption.</p>

<h3><i>Yarmouth.</i></h3>

<p>The clam industry at Yarmouth, never extensive, has steadily declined,
until now it barely supplies the demands of home consumption. Barnstable
bar on the northern coast twenty years ago produced clams in
considerable quantities, but the soil was never well adapted for this
shellfish. Scattering clams are now found there, but the grounds are
very much exposed, and cannot properly rank as clam-producing area.
Sea clams abound there at certain seasons, and furnish a transient
business; also razor clams, which are used extensively for bait.</p>

<p>The best clam territory is in Mill Creek, on the south shore of the
town. Scattered patches of clams also occur along the shore of Bass
River, but the whole area really available does not exceed 50 acres,
and this is not at all well improved. There are no regular clammers,
but intermittent digging produces about 600 bushels of clams annually,
which are used either for home consumption or for bait.</p>

<p>No effort has been made on the part of the town authorities to better
conditions, although the advisability of giving clam grants, at least
on the northern or bay side, has been discussed. No permits are
required, and local legislation does not in any way concern itself with
the clam industry.</p>

<h3><i>Orleans.</i></h3>

<p>Orleans is one of the few towns in the State which shows an advance
in the clam industry. This is largely due to an increased production
on the rich flats of Nauset harbor, as the remaining available territory
in the town is declining in value. The output of 1907 is an increase of
nearly 40 per cent. over the yield of the previous year, which shows
an encouraging development.</p>

<p>The clam flat area of the town is divided into four rather distinct
divisions, three on the east or Atlantic side and one on the Bay or
western side. The grounds which have been dug for the longest time
and yielded uniformly the best results lie in the waters of Town Cove.
Here a strip of gravelly sand and mud about 30 feet wide extends
along the shores of this cove for 2 or 3 miles. Clams are scattered
throughout this strip, and are dug constantly.</p>

<p>The second division includes the bars of Nauset harbor, which at
present furnish the best digging in town. The increased value of the
town's industry is largely due to the recent development of these flats.
Clams have seeded in abundantly during the past two or three years,
and now furnish very good digging.</p>

<p>The third section comprises that portion of the clam flat area bordering
the coast of Pleasant Bay which crosses the town boundaries on
the southeast. Here clams are rather scarce, though dug occasionally.
This section is economically the least important of the four.</p>

<p>The fourth section extends along the western coast, on a belt of sand
bars well out in Cape Cod Bay. Clams are found on a strip about a
quarter of a mile in width, and lying over half a mile from shore. This
is a very exposed location. Billingsgate Point, projecting out from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
Wellfleet coast, offers some protection from northwest winds, and the
hills of the Cape break the force of the easterly gales; but the full
force of storms from the west and southwest sweeps these bars, and
would seem to render them unsuitable for the growth of clams. Clams
are here, however, in considerable numbers, though not so numerous
as three or four years ago, and are dug to some extent.</p>

<p>The greater part of the digging is done by intermittent clammers,
who obtain perhaps 2&frac12; bushels per day. No permits are required, as
there are no town by-laws regulating the industry.</p>

<h3><i>Eastham.</i></h3>

<p>The town of Eastham is a sparsely settled community, and the clam
fishery, while not large, plays a rather important part in its business
activity. Six men depend quite largely upon it for a livelihood, while
some 30 others dig intermittently through the summer. The same
peculiar condition as at Orleans exists on the western coast. Here far
from shore clams are found in considerable numbers on the shifting
bars. The main source of supply, however, comes from the productive
sand flats of Nauset harbor.</p>

<p>These flats have seeded in only in the past two or three years, but
they have already shown latent possibilities of a future increase.
In the so-called "Salt Pond" 2 men are employed nearly the year
round in digging clams under water by a method of "churning," locally
known as "rootling."</p>

<p>The total available area in Eastham is about 200 acres. More than
half of this is sand, which includes almost all the good digging, while
the mud flats are interspersed with stretches of gravel and scattering
patches of eel grass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>The same abuses which have nearly ruined the Swansea fishery have
begun here. Small seed clams are exported in considerable quantities
to supply the summer demand of the New Bedford and Fall River
districts. While this system has not yet made its ravages apparent, a
glance at the Swansea report will serve to convince the most casual
reader that unless some steps are taken to check this evil, the practical
annihilation of the Eastham clam industry must follow. As it is, local
legislation seems powerless to cope with the problem, and no laws of
any kind relating to the clam fishery are in force.</p>

<h3><i>Wellfleet.</i></h3>

<p>Although possessing extensive flats, Wellfleet produces at present
a relatively small amount of clams. The inhabitants realize that these
flats are capable of producing a large harvest of clams if properly
planted, and that in this way an extensive industry can be developed,
and have undertaken to restock the flats, appropriating in 1906 for this
purpose the sum of $1,000.</p>

<p>At Billingsgate Island there are fair clam flats, but they are not
easily accessible, as they lie at a distance of 5 miles from town. Clams
can also be obtained in more or less abundance in the thatch which
borders the flats of Blackfish Creek, Herring River and Duck Creek.
A few clams are scattered over the flats of Blackfish Creek, particularly
toward the head of the creek. Two patches of clams covering perhaps
an acre are on the flats in front of the town: one in the stone and
gravel east of Commercial wharf; the other, a more extensive area,
just west of Mercantile wharf.</p>

<p>Wellfleet possesses many acres of flats which, though now barren,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
are capable of excellent production if properly planted. Wellfleet
flats extend from Duck Creek to Herring River and from Herring River
along the shores of Great Island for a distance of 4&frac12; miles, and cover
an area of 400 acres. The Great Island flats are not especially adapted
for clams, and only parts of these can ever be successfully cultivated,
while possibly all the area between Duck Creek and Herring River can
be reclaimed. South Wellfleet flats, which comprise an area of 200
acres, are much poorer flats, consisting for the most part of mud and
shifting sand. Only the firmer portions, about 50 acres, can be made
productive by planting with clams.</p>

<p>At Wellfleet the soft clam fishery can hardly be styled an industry.
In the winter a few men go clamming when there is nothing else to do.
The majority prefer razor clamming, which is a considerable winter
industry, owing to the demand for this bait at Provincetown. Three
men clam during the summer, doing practically all their digging at
Billingsgate, while 8 others are in this work during the winter.</p>

<p>The flats of Wellfleet were never very productive, but formerly were
capable of furnishing a far greater production than at present. This
decline is only accounted for by overdigging, which has brought about
the present scarcity.</p>

<h3><i>Truro.</i></h3>

<p>The clam flats at Truro are confined principally to the Pamet River.
At the mouth of this river near the head of the harbor bar is a sand
flat comprising several acres, where the bulk of the clams are produced.
In South Truro, Stony Bar and other similar patches of rocky beach
are fairly well bedded with clams. Scattering clams are found over
the shifting bars which skirt the main land on the bay side, but
nowhere are clams sufficiently abundant to warrant any serious attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
at exportation. Fifteen to twenty years ago clams were everywhere
much more abundant in this region than now, and in those days some
market digging was carried on. At present the needs of the home
market are with difficulty supplied from the local production, and 100
bushels per year would cover all clams dug both for food and bait. No
effort has at any time been made by the town authorities to increase the
industry, though the clam fishery, at least in the sheltered coves of
Pamet River, is not without possibilities of development.</p>

<h3><i>Provincetown.</i></h3>

<p>For the last five years the flats of Provincetown have produced only
a small amount of clams. Wherever clams have set in abundance they
have been quickly dug by fishermen for bait, thus checking their natural
propagation.</p>

<p>Clams are found in the drains among the thatch beds on the southwest
side of the harbor and in Race Run, while a considerable set is
scattered between the wharves of the town. All the extensive flats at
the southwest end of the harbor are entirely barren of clams, owing
chiefly to the shifting nature of the sand, although on certain parts of
these, especially near the thatch, clams would grow if planted. As it
is, the shifting sand makes it impossible for the young clams to set
on this area.</p>

<h3><i>Chatham.</i></h3>

<p>Chatham can no longer be considered as the best clam-producing town
of southern Massachusetts. In 1879 Chatham produced a greater
quantity of soft clams than all the rest of the Cape; to-day all has
changed, and the annual output is far less than several other towns of
the Cape district.</p>

<p>The town of Chatham is situated in the southeastern portion of Cape
Cod, and includes that part which is commonly called the "elbow" of
the Cape. It is surrounded on the north, east and south sides by the
ocean, while on the south the peninsula known as Monomoy Island
extends for 9 miles.</p>

<p>The clamming territory of Chatham is situated in Stage harbor,
Pleasant Bay and at Monomoy Point.</p>

<p>In Stage harbor clams are found along the sides of the Mill Pond,
comprising possibly an acre, and in the eastern end of the harbor
toward the dike, where about 3 acres of flats are thickly set.</p>

<p>An extended area of sand flats are found in Pleasant Bay. But
small parts of this area furnish good clamming, and the Common Flats
on the inside of Monomoy Island, where once there were acres of good
clams, now lie entirely barren except for a small patch of set just
north of Brant Island, comprising about 1/5 of an acre. Here are
about 100 acres of barren flats which only need planting to be made
productive.</p>

<p>The commercial clam fishery, of the town is carried on at Monomoy
Point, where 5 acres of the best clamming in Massachusetts is found.
The Powder Hole flats, formed of coarse, clean sand, are thickly set
with clams of all sizes, and furnish excellent digging. A good clammer
can obtain from 5 to 6 bushels per tide from these flats.</p>

<p>Clams are dug at Chatham during the fishing season chiefly for bait.
Such digging lasts through the fall and winter. In the summer, clams
are dug only for food, as no cod fishing is conducted in the warm
months. From 10 to 15 men were engaged in clamming during the
summer of 1907, travelling from Chatham to Monomoy Point in power
or sail dories. Practically all the clams dug came from the Powder Hole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
flats at Monomoy Point. These were purchased at Chatham wharf by
fish firms at the price of $2 per barrel.</p>

<p>The winter clam fishery of Chatham was once an important industry,
which started in 1875 when clams were in great demand as fish bait.
The following table shows how this industry has declined:&mdash;</p>

<p>Owing to the large amount of clams dug by fishing vessels, the following
restrictions were incorporated in 1881 as a State law, which
reads as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>No fisherman or any other person shall take from the towns of Chatham
and Nantucket any shellfish, for bait or other use, except clams and a shellfish
commonly known by the name of horse feet, and no quantity exceeding
seven bushels of clams, including shells or one hundred of said horse feet
shall be taken in one week for each vessel or craft, nor in any case without
a permit being first obtained from the selectmen of the town.</p></div>

<h3><i>Harwich.</i></h3>

<p>The town of Harwich possesses but little clam area. A few clams
are obtainable on the shores of Pleasant Bay and Mud Creek in limited
localities, while in the southern waters of the town there is some digging
in Wychmere harbor and in Herring River. The total area of clam
flats is not more than 1&frac12; acres.</p>

<p>There are no regular clammers engaged in the business, all the clams
dug being used only for home consumption.</p>

<p>In 1905 there was a town law restricting the digging in Wychmere
harbor, except for bait, to one day in the week.</p>

<h3><i>Mashpee.</i></h3>

<p>The clam fishery at Mashpee is of hardly sufficient proportions to
rank as an industry. The shores of the Popponesset River furnish
perhaps favorable conditions for the growth of this shellfish, but the
available territory is small, not exceeding 50 acres, and of this only a
small percentage, comprising scattered patches of gravel-mud, produces
clams in any abundance.</p>

<p>No effort is made at exportation for market, and under the present
circumstances it is doubtful if a greater yield than that required to
supply home consumption could be expected. No effort is made on the
part of local legislation to control the industry or foster it in any way.</p>

<h3><i>Buzzards Bay.</i></h3>

<p>The section of Massachusetts bordering the shores of Buzzards Bay
supports a flourishing quahaug, oyster and scallop fishery, capable of
great development. The clam industry, however, never very extensive,
is of very slight significance at present, and can never attain the same
degree of importance as the other shellfisheries, owing to the limited
area available for clams. To those familiar with the harbors of Newburyport
and Duxbury and their vast tidal flats with their latent possibilities,
the shores of Buzzards Bay present indeed a notable contrast.
Bluff and hilly for the most part, and frequently rocky, nowhere do
they show extensive flats suitable for clam culture. That clams grow
wherever opportunity permits is evident, for they are found on gravelly
stretches or among rocks all along the coast, except in those localities
openly exposed to the full force of the sea. But allowing for all
possible favorable features, the lack of any considerable territory is a
disadvantage that will forever act as a barrier to any expansion.
Falmouth and Dartmouth on the east and west sides of Buzzards Bay
respectively differ materially from the remaining towns of the district,
in the fact that the characteristic soil of their clam grounds is sand;
while the other towns have little in the shape of available territory
except gravel stretches along the shores of coves, small areas of mud,
and the rocky beaches of points and headlands. The yearly output
hardly anywhere suffices for the needs of home consumption. Nowhere
is any attempt at exportation possible. The business, such as it is,
is carried on in a very intermittent fashion, chiefly in the summer,
with but a small investment of capital.</p>

<p>Special local regulation seems to remain aloof from the problem of
insuring a future clam supply. That the combined area of all the
towns of Buzzards Bay does not equal that of a single town in the
Cape Ann district is an undeniable truth; but the fact nevertheless
remains that an industry far more considerable than exists at present
could be supported, and it is truly to the interest of the towns of this
region to make the best possible use of their limited advantages.</p>


<h3><i>Falmouth.</i></h3>

<p>Falmouth has a long coast line not only on Buzzards Bay but also on
Vineyard Sound. The flats at North and West Falmouth on the bay
side are similar to those of Wareham and Bourne, though there are
several small patches of quite good digging. On the southern shore
there are clams scattered along the coasts of the various indentations,
particularly at Waquoit Bay.</p>

<h3><i>Bourne.</i></h3>

<p>The clam industry at Bourne is practically extinct. Scarcely any
clamming is carried on by the inhabitants of the town, even for their
own use, as clams have become so scattering that it hardly pays to dig
them. The territory is much the same in extent and general character
as that of Wareham, but it has been over-dug to a greater degree, and
has become nearly barren.</p>

<h3><i>Wareham.</i></h3>

<p>Wareham leads the towns of Buzzards Bay in the production of
clams, although its annual output is only 600 bushels. This clearly
shows the low ebb to which the industry has fallen in this region.</p>

<p>There are no true tide flats in Wareham, but the total area of the
mud-gravel and rocky bottom between high and low water mark where
scattering clams are found is nearly 100 acres. There are no regular
fishermen, but some half dozen quahaugers dig clams from time to
time, chiefly during the summer, to supply the home market.</p>

<p>The industry, such as it is, appears to be about stationary at present,
though in production it has declined notably during the last twenty
years. The town officials have attempted no measures to revive the
failing fishery, and no town laws affect it in any way.</p>

<h3><i>Marion.</i></h3>

<p>The wealthy summer residents at Marion create a demand for clams
at a very substantial price. In spite of the increased price, there is
little inducement to engage in this industry as a livelihood, and only
1 man digs steadily through the summer months, though intermittent
digging is done by others to supply the local market.</p>

<p>The best clamming is on the east coast of Great Neck and in Wing's
Cove. These grounds are difficult of access, and consequently have not
been so much overworked as the nearer shores of Ram's Island, Allan's
Point and Blankinship's Cove. The total area does not exceed 10 acres,
and this for the most part is very poor territory; while the clams coming
from these rock and gravel beaches are not of very good quality, the
shells being usually gnarled and crooked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no town legislation relating to this industry, and though it is
becoming of less consequence every year, nothing is done to revive it.</p>

<h3><i>Mattapoisett.</i></h3>

<p>The coast of Mattapoisett, more open and exposed than that of Fairhaven,
does not offer equal advantages to the cultivation of clams. A
similar strip of gravel-mud or sand occurs along the more sheltered
portions of the coast, and wherever an indentation in the mainland
offers shelter clams may be found, though never in sufficient quantities
to make digging profitable. There is really no industry at all; the few
clams that are dug go for home trade or are used as bait, and the
prospects of any decided improvement appear to be slight.</p>

<h3><i>Fairhaven.</i></h3>

<p>The clam industry at Fairhaven suffers from the unsanitary condition
of the flats, though in a lesser degree than at New Bedford. The finest
clam grounds of this town lie in the proscribed district of the Acushnet
River, and handling or eating shellfish from this area is a positive
menace to the public health.</p>

<p>A strip of gravel-mud about 100 feet in average width fringes the
shores of Priest's Cove, and this strip furnishes at present the best
digging. Scattered patches of clams occur along the indentations of
Sconticut Neck, around West Island and along the coast of Little Bay.
No men are regularly employed in digging clams, though a rather
inefficient attempt is made at times to supply the local demand.</p>

<h3><i>New Bedford.</i></h3>

<p>The clam industry at New Bedford was never of any great importance,
but the unwise methods of sewage disposal of the city,
whereby the effluent enters the harbor in close proximity to the clam
flats, renders the taking of shellfish a positive menace to the public
health. The action of the State Board of Health in closing the Acushnet
River and Clark's Cove to the clam digger virtually annihilated the
remnant of the industry. Now practically all the available territory
of the city is proscribed, and no clams are allowed to be taken from this
area except for use as bait. Licenses are also required to take clams
even for bait from this proscribed territory. Three hundred and
twenty of these licenses have been issued since the passage of the act
in 1904. The annual yield of clams for this purpose cannot be accurately
ascertained, but probably does not exceed 250 bushels. No
important clam industry would ever have been possible at New Bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>ford,
under any circumstances, but the slight possibilities which once
existed have been swept away and can never return under the present
conditions, though shellfish grown in this region could, if suitable
legislation were enacted, be transplanted to a sanitary environment,
where in a month all danger of spreading typhoid germs would be
avoided.</p>

<h3><i>Dartmouth.</i></h3>

<p>The town of Dartmouth possesses a wide expanse of territory, but
the actual amount of available clam ground is not as large as it would
appear at first sight. Clams are found in more or less abundance at
the following places: (1) Rickerson's Point (2/3 acre); (2) Apponagansett
River (6 acres); (3) Apponagansett harbor (1 acre); (4)
Nonquit (1/10 acre); (5) Round Hill Point (1/5 acre); (6) Salter's Point
(3/4 acre); (7) Smith's Neck (3/5 acre); (8) Little River (7-1/2 acres);
(9) Slocum's River (6 acres); comprising a total of 23 acres. The best
clamming is obtained on the flats of Little and Slocum's rivers. In
Apponagansett River clams are dug in the summer for the Padanaram
clam bakes.</p>

<p>A town by-law placing a closed season on Slocum's River was in
force during the years 1904 and 1905. In 1906 Dartmouth, by a State
law, required permits for clamming. These permits are issued by the
selectmen free of charge.</p>

<h3><i>The Fall River District (Narragansett Bay).</i></h3>

<p>The section of country bordering on Narragansett Bay and the
Rhode Island line comprises a territory remote from the other clam-producing
districts of the State, and possessing many characteristics
not found in any other locality. Six towns of this region enjoy the
privileges of a clam industry, situated as they are on the shores of Mt.
Hope Bay and its tributary streams, the Cole, Lee and Taunton rivers.
Beginning with the most westerly and taking them in order, these
towns comprise Swansea, Somerset, Dighton, Berkley, Freetown and
Fall River. These towns differ only in extent of resources or development
of the industry, while the general nature of the clam flats and the
methods employed in carrying on the business are essentially alike for
all. The area in this region suitable for clam culture possesses some of
the distinguishing features of the typical north shore flats, some of the
Buzzards Bay variety and some peculiar to itself. There are scarcely
any sand flats, and the prevailing type of soil is mud, as at Newburyport,
or gravel, as in Buzzards Bay; while the greater part of the clam
supply comes from a large and rather indefinite area, which is not
properly tide flat at all, but lies continuously submerged.</p>

<p>The methods employed in carrying on this industry include both wet
and dry digging. On the tide flats the clams are dug as elsewhere on
the south shore, with hoes or the common digger. Where, however,
clams are dug in 2 or 3 feet of water, as is most frequently the case,
an ordinary long-handled shovel and wire basket are employed. The
soil containing the clams is shoveled into the baskets, and then the clams
are sifted out under water. Several years ago an attempt was made
to dig clams by machinery. An enterprising oysterman spent several
hundred dollars in constructing a machine which was designed to farm
the under-water districts more quickly and successfully than could be
done by hand. The device had some of the principles of a suction
pump, and theoretically the clams on the submerged flats could be
washed out from the soil and collected in a receptacle. The machine
worked well enough in extracting the clams from the mud, but failed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
completely when it came to collecting them. In short, after a thorough
trial it was pronounced a failure and had to be abandoned.</p>

<p>The main peculiarity of this region, and a far more important one
than the type of soil or the methods of digging, is the nature of the
clams which are produced. The inadequate territory and the constantly
increasing demands of the Fall River markets have led to abuses which
have had a most disastrous effect on the clam industry, and unless
checked, and soon, these abuses will certainly cause its complete annihilation.
The abuses in question are the universal custom of digging small
seed clams for food. So importunate have the markets of Fall River
and the vicinity become, that when the supply of suitable clams proves
inadequate they demand and will gladly take "anything with a shell
on," as the dealers say, so that it is no uncommon sight to see exposed
for sale in the city markets clams of only 1 inch in length. This
deplorable condition is fostered by the custom of digging under water,
for the fine mesh of the woven-wire baskets retains even the smallest
clams, which are saved for market.</p>

<p>No quicker or surer way of destroying the industry completely could
have been devised than this method of digging seed clams for food.
One barrel of these clams would produce 10 to 15 barrels of marketable
clams if left for one year under favorable circumstances. Thus, when
a clammer digs 1 barrel of these clams he is in reality destroying 10 or
more barrels. This is truly reaping the "seed" before it has had any
time to mature the proper harvest. Also, these "seed" clams are so
immature that in many cases they have not spawned, and thus the
clammer by destroying the clams in this manner damages irrevocably
all chances of restocking the flats.</p>

<p>From the inherent difficulties of the problem, however, local regulation
seems powerless to cope with the evil. The short-sighted clammers,
while they know that these methods, if pursued very far, will ultimately
destroy the industry, seem willing, nevertheless, to sacrifice the future
for the present. The other clammers are inevitably brought into line
on this mistaken policy, as they cannot but argue that if a few will
persist in exploiting a natural resource it is the right of every man
to have an equal chance, and take his share of the proceeds as long
as they last. Another potent factor in this wastefulness is the irresponsible
foreign element of the mill districts, who dig clams for their
own use, large or small, with entire indifference. It might perhaps
prove unjust and difficult to enforce laws preventing individuals
digging "seed" clams for their own use; but legislation could possibly
be enacted preventing the sale of such seed in the public market. This
would strike a blow at the abuse sufficient to rob it of its worst
features. The most casual glance at the facts in the case prove that
there is a pressing need for some legislative action. The history of the
clam industry in this region is one of steady and rapid decline. Any
clammer of the vicinity is willing to acknowledge that conditions at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
present are in a very unsatisfactory state. The output of clams has
greatly diminished, both in the consensus of opinion of those interested
in the business, and also according to statistical figures. Furthermore,
the end of the industry, as far as any economic importance is concerned,
is plainly in sight, and at the present rate of destruction cannot
long be delayed. It would seem that here was a striking example of
the need of prompt and wise legislation for the protection and development
of an industry which has made large profits for the community,
and might yield still greater returns if properly regulated.</p>

<p>The towns of this region can never compete with the towns of the
Newburyport district in the production of clams, for the reason that
they have by no means an equal acreage of suitable flats. The Taunton
River is also a considerable factor, as its contaminated waters impair
the quality of clams grown along its shores. There remains, however,
a considerable extent of suitable territory which might yield a large
product if rightly controlled, and this territory, with its inherent
possibilities depleted to the verge of exhaustion by unwise and wasteful
methods, it is for the interest of the Commonwealth to protect and
improve.</p>


<h3><i>Swansea.</i></h3>

<p>Swansea, the most western town of this district, is by far the most
favorably located, and has the greatest possibilities of clam production.
Situated on the northern shore of Mt. Hope Bay, and containing the
majority of the flats in the Cole and Lee rivers, it possesses a greater
available territory free from the contaminating influences of the
Taunton River than any other town in this region.</p>

<p>Altogether, 200 acres comprise the possibly available clam area of
this town. The best of this area is located in Cole's River, and includes
Long Beach flat, the best flat of the district. Situated on the east
shore of the river just below the railroad bridge, this flat stretches south
in a broad triangle comprising some 20 acres of smooth, semihard mud.
Over the main flat is sprinkled a very thick set of &frac12; inch to 1 inch
clams, interspersed with some of larger growth. While this is the best
flat, other flats extend along both shores far up the river until the
clams become too "fresh" to be very good. Flats also occur in the
Lee River, and there is a large and rather indeterminate amount of
under-water territory. The total area suitable for culture is not far
from 150 acres; of this, about 20 acres are gravel and the rest practically
all mud.</p>

<p>No permits are necessary to dig clams on tidal flats, but permits are
required to "churn" clams under water. Twenty of these permits
were issued last year. Usually in digging under water two men work
together, one shovelling the mud into the wire baskets and the other
sifting out the clams. About 75 per cent. of the clams produced come
from these under-water areas, as the tide flats are for the most part
nearly exhausted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>The season lasts all the year round, though most of the clams are
dug in the summer time. Of late years it has become increasingly
hard for a man to earn a living by clamming, as only 1 to 1&frac12; bushels
now comprise an average day's work under the most favorable circumstances.
Many of the clammers are leaving the business and seeking a
livelihood in other employments.</p>

<p>The history of the industry is one of marked decline. The most
conservative clammer estimates that at the present rate the passing of
five years will witness the complete annihilation of the industry.</p>

<h3><i>Somerset.</i></h3>

<p>Somerset, the next town in order, joins Swansea on the east and
extends several miles up the left bank of the Taunton River. Its flats
on the south and west, particularly in the Lee River, produce some
clams, though the industry is practically run out. The total clam area
comprises about 75 acres. This is mostly mud, though gravel stretches
along the shore aggregate perhaps 10 acres. The development of latent
possibilities in this territory is largely curtailed by the disastrous effects
of the Taunton River upon the clams. This water, contaminated by
the manufacturing plants of Taunton, makes the clams grown in the
northern part of the town of inferior taste and quality.</p>

<p>Six licenses, costing $1 apiece, were issued last year for "churning"
clams. No permits other than these are required.</p>

<h3><i>Dighton.</i></h3>

<p>Dighton has a very limited area of clam flat, comprising only about
10 acres. Clams extend but little beyond the southern boundary of the
town on the Taunton River and about &frac34; mile up the Segregansett
River on the west. Practically no business is made of clamming by the
citizens of the town except for local consumption. About 40 bushels
were "churned" last year by outsiders. No permits are issued.</p>

<h3><i>Berkley.</i></h3>

<p>Berkley, on the right bank of the Taunton River, opposite Dighton,
has a very similar clam territory both in extent and characteristics.
But little use is made of the clam except for bait, as the river water
renders them very unsatisfactory as food.</p>

<p>There is practically no industry, and there never could be any of
importance, owing to the very limited area and the contamination of
the waters.</p>

<h3><i>Freetown.</i></h3>

<p>Freetown, joining Berkley on the south near the Fall River line,
possesses a number of clam flats, aggregating 25 acres. Very little
business is carried on, although conditions are better than in Berkley
or Dighton. The clams, too, are of better quality, being freer from the
disagreeable flavor of clams grown farther up the river. The possibilities
for clam culture in this town are not attractive, but the present
conditions can be vastly improved.</p>

<h3><i>Nantucket.</i></h3>

<p>At present Nantucket does not possess a clam industry of any importance.
Years ago it is claimed that clams were abundant, and that
quantities were dug for food or for bait. Now the reverse is true, and
the fisherman often finds it difficult to procure clams even for bait.
Indeed, Nantucket furnishes an excellent illustration of the decline of
the clam industry.</p>

<p>Practically all the flats of Nantucket are shore flats <i>i.e.</i>, narrow flats
along the shores of the harbor and on the sides of the creeks. Thus the
area, though extending for many miles, is not great, and the clam
industry of the island, though capable of development, nevertheless can
never assume the importance of the quahaug and the scallop fisheries.
In Nantucket harbor clams are found in the creeks, and particularly
in Polpis harbor, although scattering clams are found all along the
south shore of the harbor. A few clams are found on the north side
in Coatou Creek and in First and Second Bend. The flats in Nantucket
harbor are all coarse sand or a fine gravel, except in the creeks,
where they become muddy. On the eastern and southern sides clams
are found in scattering quantities in Maddequet harbor, on the north
side of Tuckernuck and in the cove on the south side of Muskeget.</p>

<h3><i>Edgartown.</i></h3>

<p>Although Edgartown possesses 200 acres of clam flats, it is not in a
true sense a clam-producing town. The reason for this small production
is due to the nature of the flats, which are mostly under water at low
tide, making clamming difficult. Naturally Edgartown devotes its
energies to the more profitable quahaug and scallop fisheries.</p>

<p>The clam flats of the town are situated along the shores of Cape
Poge Pond and in the lower part of Katama Bay, where many acres
of flats are continually submerged. The shore flats are of small area,
owing to the light rise and fall of the tide, less than 3 feet at this part
of the coast.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Cape Poge Pond.</i>&mdash;Scattering clams are found all along the
shore flats, except for a &frac34;-mile strip on the west side. The soil is of a
coarse sand or gravel.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Katama Bay.</i>&mdash;The best clam flats of the town are situated in
Katama Bay, and extend over a considerable territory. These flats,
consisting of a coarse, sandy soil, lie continually submerged. Here the
clams are dug by means of a "sea horse." This "animal" is nothing
more than an elongated clam hoe with a belt attachment, whereby the
clammer can "churn" out the clams at a depth of 2 to 3 feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>The clam industry of Edgartown has fallen off considerably since
1879. However, the clammers say that it has improved during the last
fifteen years. The following comparison is made between the production

<p>The general shellfish regulations which govern the other shellfisheries
of the town apply to the clam fishery; but the industry has never been
considered important enough to need special legislation, and but slight
attention has been given to it.</p>

<p>In the opinion of many, doubtless, this report may appear unduly
lengthy, and to include many seemingly trivial facts and unnecessary
repetitions. To the trained observer, however, it seems of the greatest
importance in dealing with such a practical and important problem
to place on record all facts and opinions which may become of value,
and to emphasize by frequent repetitions certain fundamental facts.</p>

<p class="center">Respectfully submitted,
</p>

<p class="right">D. L. BELDING.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>The preceding report is intended to be a reliable statement
of facts, and suggestions for consideration. On such a basis of
facts the future policy of developing the shellfisheries must be
based. It is the purpose of the Commissioners on Fisheries and
Game to hold a series of public hearings in the different sections
of the State for the purpose of giving personal expositions of
the shellfish conditions and possibilities, and of giving a better
opportunity for exchanging, discussing and weighing opinions.
Meantime, in considering the conditions of the shellfisheries of
Massachusetts, and the laws necessary to improve these conditions,
the following points are of importance.</p>

<p>The present shellfish laws are based upon the principle of
"public" fisheries, and were made at times and at places where
there was such a superabundance that the natural increase was
sufficient to meet the market demands. Artificial cultivation was
unnecessary. The fundamental laws were made in the colonial
days. Since then the demand for shellfish as food has enormously
increased, and for many years the annual natural increase
has been entirely inadequate to meet these demands. We
have outgrown the conditions which the original conception of
that law covered. Under parallel conditions it has been found
necessary to sell or lease the public lands, in order that the yield
of food may be increased by cultivation under the immediate
direction and responsibility of individual citizens, and under
protection of State and national laws. When it was learned that
the yield of a cultivated oyster bed far exceeded the natural
product both in quantity and quality, the oyster laws were so
modified that an important industry was built up, until to-day
practically the entire oyster yield of Massachusetts, Rhode
Island and Connecticut is from cultivated beds, and the total
product is many times the total catch from the natural beds in
their palmiest days. To-day not only is it necessary to so modify
the oyster laws as to increase the opportunities for better utilizing
our bays and estuaries for oyster growing on a more extensive
scale than is done at present, but also for developing similar
methods of growing clams and quahaugs, and perhaps also
scallops. The tidal flats must, as well as the deeper waters, be
made to produce food and money by securing a larger yield per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
acre, and by the utilization of thousands of acres which are now
practically idle, but which either are now adapted for growing
shellfish or can readily be made so.</p>

<p>Our present shellfish laws are a heterogeneous, conflicting
patchwork, devised to meet temporary and local conditions,
utterly inadequate to-day to permit the fishermen to secure a
just return for their labor, and completely sacrificing the public
interests. In many cases the responsible tax-paying citizen
cannot find a place to dig a family supply of clams or quahaugs,
neither can the industrious native fisherman get a fair day's pay
for his labor.</p>

<p>An entirely new code of shellfish laws is necessary, based upon
the general principles (1) that in selling the shores the State
reserved the right of fishing as "far as the tide doth ebb and
flow," and (2) that the State may now lease these fishing rights
under such conditions and restrictions as to secure to every
citizen so desiring and so deserving an opportunity to cultivate
such a definite area as may meet his needs and powers. Experience
has proved conclusively that it is a correct economic principle
for the State to give a secure title to certain carefully
defined lands to a capable man, and to say: "This land is yours.
You may raise potatoes, corn, hay or anything you choose.
Every plant, fruit or tree growing on this property is yours.
You have become responsible for its right and proper use. You
have full and complete rights in this property, and can develop
it by investing your labor and your money according to your own
judgment, and the State will protect you in these rights as long
as you do not interfere with the rights of other persons."
Equally so it is an indubitable economic fact that the landowner
finds it more profitable to plant or transplant corn, potatoes,
grass, strawberries, etc., rather than to depend upon the natural
methods and yield. Similarly, it is equally logical for the State
to give to the fisherman equal opportunities with the farmer.
The State should guarantee the tenure of the fisherman in his
definitely bounded shellfish garden, and should protect his interests
and the property on that garden as securely as if it were
potatoes or corn, and should, so far as possible, guard him from
local jealousy or the effects of petty politics so long as he con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>tinues
wisely to improve his grant in conformity to the spirit
and letter of laws which are found by experience to give the
greatest good to the greatest number.</p>

<p>Further, the State should protect the fishermen and the consumers
of shellfish by defining the areas which from a sanitary
point of view are (1) totally unsuitable for shellfish cultivation;
(2) those where shellfish may be grown but not eaten; and,
finally, (3) definite areas from which alone shellfish may be sold
for food. Provide suitable penalties for sale of shellfish which
have not been kept for the required time (at least thirty days) in
sanitary surroundings before going to market. The entire
question of pollution of streams and estuaries must be carefully
considered in view of the public rights and of the commercial
interests of the fishermen. Further, the laws must be so carefully
drawn that the respective rights and interests of individual
fishermen, shore owners, summer cottagers and the transient
public at the seashore are completely safeguarded against the
dangers of predatory wealth monopolizing the opportunities for
cultivating shellfish in the waters and the tidal flats.</p>

<p>The situation is extremely complicated on account of the
diverse conditions and the numerous conflicting interests, oystermen,
quahaugers, clammers and scallopers, native and alien
fishermen, owners of shore property, town and State rights,
local interests and petty politics, and careful judicial consideration
is necessary not alone as to the substance of the necessary
laws, but upon the methods of administering these laws.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><b>Scallop Dredge</b>,&mdash;"<b>The Scraper.</b>"&mdash;This implement has the form of a triangular iron framework, with a curve of nearly 90&deg; at the base, to
form the bowl of the dredge. On the upper side a raised cross bar connects the two arms, while at the bottom a strip of iron 2 inches wide extends
across the dredge. This narrow strip acts as a scraping blade, and is set at an angle so as to dig into the soil. The top of the net is fastened to the
cross bar and the lower part to the blade. The usual dimensions of the dredge are: arms, 2&frac12; feet; upper cross bar, 2 feet; blade, 2&frac12; feet. The net
varies in size, usually running from 2 to 3 feet in length and holding between 1 and 2 bushels. Additional weights can be put on the cross bar
when the scalloper desires the dredge to "scrape" deeper. A wooden bar 2 feet long buoys the net. The scraper used at Nantucket has the entire
net made of twine, whereas in other localities the lower part consists of interwoven iron rings.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p><b>The Oyster Dredge.</b>&mdash;This is the type of oyster dredge used on the large gasolene boats. The photograph was taken on board the oyster boat
of Mr. James Monahan of Wareham. The dredge consists of a net of woven iron rings attached to an iron framework. From each corner of the
framework rods extend, converging at a point some feet away, where the drag rope is attached. The blade, resting horizontally on the surface, is
armed with large teeth which rake the oysters into the bag. When this bag, which holds from 8 to 15 bushels, is full, the dredge is raised by a gasolene
hoist.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p><b>The Basket Quahaug Rake.</b>&mdash;This style of basket rake is used at Edgartown and Nantucket. The whole rake is made of iron, no netting
being required, as thin iron wires 1/3 of an inch apart encircle lengthwise the entire basket, preventing the escape of any marketable quahaugs, while
at the same time allowing mud and sand to wash out. This rake has 16 steel teeth, 1&frac12; inches long, fitted at intervals of 1 inch on the scraping bar.
The depth of the basket is about 8 inches. Short poles not exceeding 30 feet in length are used, as the raking is carried on in water which does not
exceed 25 feet in depth. Only the iron framework of the rake is shown.</p></div>

it. The bowl is formed by a curve of the prongs, which are held together by two long cross bars at the top and bottom of the basket, while the ends
are enclosed by short strips of iron. Handles from 15 to 20 feet long are generally used with this rake.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p><b>Rowley Reef Clam Set.</b>&mdash;This photograph shows the surface of Rowley Reef, one of the flats of Plum Island Sound. In the summer of 1906 a
heavy set of clams was found on this flat, averaging 1,500 to the square foot of surface. These rapidly diminished, and one year later, Aug. 27, $1
when this photograph was taken, the clams numbered about 400 to the square foot. This area furnished an excellent illustration of the great destruction
of natural clam set. Only 5 per cent. of these clams reached maturity, and the remaining 95 per cent., destroyed by natural agencies, could have
been saved if proper measures had been taken. At least 100 acres of the barren flats of Rowley could have been planted with the "seed" from this
flat, and after two years the crop would have been worth $30,000. The present shellfish laws of the Commonwealth are alone to blame for this waste.
The clam hoe shown in the foreground is the typical digger or "hooker" of the North Shore clammer.</p></div>
